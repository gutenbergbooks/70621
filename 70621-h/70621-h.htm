<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>The primary object of this book is to present, in concise
form, a large variety of facts which have been and are, in
one way or another, of value or importance to those who
are interested in the Rhodes Scholarships.</p>

<p>The frequency and the diversity of the inquiries which
have been made, both officially and unofficially, and
especially the questions which have been asked by and
of Rhodes Scholars, have suggested the practicability of
an attempt to compile an elementary reference-book which
shall contain answers to many of these queries.</p>

<p>It must be clearly understood at the outset that this
volume is <i>in no way official</i>, having been in no way
authorized or approved by the Rhodes Trust or by Oxford
University. For the fact of its appearance and for its
form and contents the authors (or, perhaps better, the
‘editors’ of the material which it contains) must and do
assume the sole responsibility. Yet for the facts which
it contains we have had recourse to official or semi-official
publications, and for accuracy we plead the authority of
these sources.</p>

<p>Inquiries have varied from such simple questions as
‘How many Rhodes Scholars are there in Oxford?’ to,
‘How may a Rhodes Scholarship be obtained; how does
Oxford differ in system from an American University;
what courses of study can I pursue at Oxford?’ It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
hoped that the facts contained in the following chapters
will answer a large number of these questions, and that
they may not only save much time and perplexity for
those who are especially interested in the Rhodes Scholarships,
but that they may be of considerable additional
use in explaining many points which are popularly misunderstood
or overlooked with regard to the Rhodes
Scholarships and their relation to Oxford.</p>

<p>Our purpose to compile at once a short record and a
working handbook has made our task largely that of selection
and arrangement. We have drawn freely for information
upon many sources. Thus, the first chapter is
based almost entirely upon facts set forth in Mr. W. T.
Stead’s <i>Last Will and Testament of Cecil John Rhodes</i>; the
second chapter is merely an arrangement from a copy
of Rhodes’s Will; the third rests upon information obtained
from Dr. Parkin’s written statements, especially
from an article in the London <i>Times</i> of October 13,
1904, and from an address before the Royal Colonial
Institute (December, 1904), and from answers which have
been given to direct questions; the fourth is based on
published ‘Memoranda’ of the Rhodes Trust; and the
sixth represents a condensation or rearrangement, with
some personal comment, of information from the official
publications of the University of Oxford (see also
Bibliography, <a href="#Page_169">p. 169</a>). The fifth and the seventh may be
said to have more of the personal colouring, but they, too,
represent impressions gained from various reading and
comparison of opinions, as well as of those of personal
experience.</p>

<p>The division into Parts I and II has been determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
by the fact that the first four chapters (Part I) deal
largely with matters outside Oxford, while the remainder
(Part II) deals rather with Oxford phases of the question.
In addition to the desire to present general
information it has been our constant purpose to meet
the questions—first, of the person who is considering
whether he wishes a Rhodes Scholarship; second, of
the person who is an intending candidate; third, of the
elected Rhodes Scholar.</p>

<p>This motive has prompted the addition of considerable
matter in the form of an Appendix which contains:
a List of the Rhodes Scholars up to date; a List of the
Committees of Selection; a set of questions illustrating
the qualifying examination; a list of the members of
the Instructional Staff of the University; a Lecture
List illustrating the Oxford ‘Honour School’ Lectures;
a list of Affiliated and Privileged Universities; and a
Bibliography. We have endeavoured by means of a complete
Index to make it possible to find at once the information,
so far as herein contained, which one is seeking.</p>

<p>Although disclaiming all or any official authorization,
and wishing to involve no one in the responsibility for
the appearance or the character of these chapters, we feel
that it would be misleading and ungrateful not to acknowledge
our indebtedness to those without whose assistance
much of the information could not have been obtained, or
could only have been obtained with great difficulty. We
have occasion to thank, for very material assistance and
for many valuable suggestions, Dr. G. R. Parkin, Mr. F. J.
Wylie, and Mr. H. T. Gerrans. Dr. Parkin and Mr. Wylie,
as officially connected with the Rhodes Trust, have given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
us access to Memoranda, and have given information on
many points connected with the Scholarship System.
Mr. Gerrans, Fellow of Worcester College, has explained
and furnished information on many difficult points in the
Oxford system, and has otherwise considerably simplified
the problem of arrangement and publication. Our thanks
are due also to Mr. L. Cecil Jane of University College
for very helpful suggestions. For whatever errors or
shortcomings may be discovered we alone are responsible.</p>

<p>Readers should also bear in mind that the ‘System’ of
the Rhodes Scholarships is still to some extent in its trial
stages, and that changes in its methods and machinery
may still be expected.</p>

<p>Our sole incentive for the production of such a book <i>at
this time</i> lies in a desire to meet what has seemed a present
need for a collection of information upon the Scholarships
as they exist. We would only justify this attempt in so
far as it may accomplish this end.</p>

<p>Cecil Rhodes left to the world a Will whose provisions
have caused more comment than those of any
other Will of modern times. A simple paraphrase of its
chief provision would be ‘I Cecil John Rhodes leave
£2,000,000 for the foundation of between 150 and 200
perpetual scholarships at Oxford University.’ To stop,
however, with such a summary is to know nothing of
the real character of the Will. Aside from being a legal
document disposing of property, the Will is an excellent
commentary upon Rhodes’s life and thought and a record
of certain of his conclusions. Its value to our present
subject, however, is rather prospective than retrospective.
Rhodes provided not <i>only</i> the money for the foundation,
but a detailed memorandum of the principles which he
wished his Trustees and Executors to keep in mind in
establishing the Rhodes Scholarships.</p>

<p>The first essential, then, to an understanding of the
Rhodes Scholarships is to be familiar with the clauses of
the Will which are the foundation upon which they rest,
and which determine the general shape of their structure.</p>

<p>It may be well, however, and a considerable aid to an
understanding of the Will, to remind ourselves first of a
few important incidents in the life of Rhodes—incidents
which go far to explain his motives and methods.</p>

<p>Rhodes entered Oriel College, Oxford, in 1873. A few
months later, being in bad health, he was sent by his
physician to South Africa. This forced trip spelled
Opportunity in large letters before him. Keen perception,
ingenuity, and careful application forged the links
between opportunity and wealth. But wealth was not
a goal; it became an instrument for the realization of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
ideals. Coincident with the success of his business
schemes, and intimately correlated with his practical
thinking, was the development of a personal and political
philosophy which shaped his ideas of the value and
proper function of wealth.</p>

<p>Rhodes had not been a brilliant student; but he was
a persistent and a logical thinker. Long before he finished
his College course he had set himself certain problems
such as seldom occur to the ordinary man, and whose
solution is rarely attempted even by extraordinary men.
What was most important, he met his problems squarely,
carried his thinking to conclusions, and his conclusions
into practice.</p>

<p>Throughout his life he cherished a fond memory of his
student days and a deep reverence for his University.
His high respect for Oxford grew not alone from the
happy impressions of early and careless years. He matriculated
when twenty years old. For the next eight
years he alternated between winters spent in South
Africa amid the influences of frontier life, and summers
spent in the social and academic atmosphere of Oxford.
When, after eight years, he took his degrees, B.A. and
M.A. together (1881), he was already a successful business
man, well on his way to maturity (<i>b.</i> 1853). Thus
he had been an Oxford undergraduate both as a youth
and as a man, and had learned the theories and practices
of Oxford side-by-side with the practical experiences of
business life during the impressionable years of early
manhood.</p>

<p>During these undergraduate days he had been deeply
impressed by a passage from Aristotle—‘Virtue is the
highest activity of the soul living for the highest object
in a perfect life.’ He appreciated Aristotle’s emphasis
upon the necessity for having a high ideal and for
struggling toward that ideal. He revolved in his mind
while in Oxford and in Africa, as he went and came, and
during his summers here and his winters there, many
problems as to the end and object of existence. What is
the end of the process of evolution? Is it man? For
what end does man exist? Why do I exist? What
does my existence demand of me? Is there a God? If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
so, what does he wish man to do? What would he
have me do? What can I do best?</p>

<p>He became conscious of a desire for power—effective,
creative power, the power which ‘does things.’ He early
decided, and he never changed his opinion, that the ‘open
sesame’ to the realm of power was money. The opportunity
for making money lay before him; the ability and
the business capacity lay within him; money was his.
Yet wealth was not his end; he never made money an
end; it was always a means.</p>

<p>His self-interrogation did not cease. He decided that
his first great duty was to his country. What is this
duty?—he asked himself. Naturally, to further her interests.
Her interests are?—Those of the British Empire.
And those are?—To advance civilization and the cause of
universal peace. What could he do? He decided that
he would ‘paint as much as possible of the map of South
Africa British red’. But patriotism should not be selfish—nor
should it be narrow. He looked beyond the boundaries
of the Empire. ‘What race can do, is doing, and
will do most to advance civilization?’ He answered
himself that the Anglo-Saxon race was the race of the
Present and of the Future—the instrument of Destiny.
Therefore, he would devote himself to the ideas which the
Anglo-Saxon race represents.</p>

<p>These conclusions were recorded in a ‘draft of some
of my ideas’ which Rhodes put upon paper while in
Kimberley, when he was about twenty-four years of age
(1877). He continued with a consideration of how his
ideas might be made effective. His fancy suggested the
formation of a kind of secular church which should have
its members in all parts of the Empire, especially at the
Universities, and whose common interest should be the
extension of the Empire. He sketched the kind of men
upon whom he could depend, the method by which they
might be recruited, keeping ever in mind ‘the closer
union of England and her Colonies’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Will, 1877.</div>

<p>That same year he wrote a Will in which he directed
that all his estates and effects of every kind should be
administered to promote British rule; to perfect a system
of emigration from the United Kingdom to the Colonies;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
to further the consolidation of the British Empire; to
assist towards the restoration of Anglo-Saxon unity;
towards securing the representation of the Colonies in
Parliament, and the foundation of a Power so great as to
render wars impossible and to promote the best interests
of humanity.</p>

<p>At that early period, then, we find—not the idea of
the Rhodes Scholarships—but the ideas which dominated
Rhodes’s subsequent imperial theories, the soil which was
ready to receive the suggestion which seems later to have
come spontaneously, of founding and defining a scholarship
system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second Will, 1882.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Third Will, 1888.</div>

<p>This Will of 1877 was suspended in 1882 by a very
informal Will written on a single sheet of note-paper,
and that in turn was revoked and replaced by a third
in 1888.</p>

<p>In 1889 Rhodes met Mr. W. T. Stead, then editor of
the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, and the two men discovered a
remarkable coincidence in their ideas, especially on the
subjects of an English-speaking reunion and a society for
the promotion of world welfare and peace.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mr. Rhodes
set forth a number of his political ideals at considerable
length.</p>

<p>His earlier devotion to the idea of British ascendancy,
while not lost, had become but a part of his larger idea
of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. So unbiased had he become
that in 1891 he expressed himself as so desirous of seeing
an English-speaking union that he would be willing that
the English monarchical system and isolated imperial
existence be sacrificed, if necessary, to its achievement.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fourth Will, 1891.</div>

<p>In 1891 he signed his fourth Will, making over his
real and personal property to two persons, one of whom
was ‘W. T. Stead of the Review of Reviews’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fifth Will, 1893.</div>

<p>The fifth Will was drafted in 1892 and signed by
Mr. Rhodes in 1893. The name of Mr. Hawksley was
added as one of the Executors, and joint-heir. It was
understood that Mr. Stead was the ‘custodian of the
Rhodesian ideas’, and the other two Executors were to
direct necessary financial and legal measures.</p>

<p>In January, 1895, Rhodes first announced to Mr. Stead
his intention of founding a number of scholarships. He
said that while on the Red Sea in 1893 the thought had
struck him of creating a number of scholarships at a
residential English University to be open to various
British Colonies. His proposition at that time was to
provide for twelve scholarships at Oxford each year, each
tenable for three years, of a value of £250 per year. A
codicil was added to the fifth Will providing for these
scholarships for Canada, the Australian Colonies, including
Western Australia and Tasmania, and for Cape Colony.</p>

<p>A good many things happened in the life of Rhodes
between the time he left England in February, 1895, and
the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899. There was the
Johannesburg Raid, for instance; and there were all
those strenuous preliminaries to the war in which Rhodes
stood as the champion of what his imperial school considered
the true rights of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sixth Will, 1899.</div>

<p>In July, 1899, before the outbreak of the War, Rhodes
recast and expanded the whole scheme of his Will and
substituted, for that of 1893, a sixth document, which
became his ‘Last Will and Testament’,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> wherein he outlined
and provided plans and detailed directions for
establishing the scholarships which are now known as
the <i>Rhodes Scholarships</i>. Each of the friends who became
a Trustee doubtless had a share in the discussions and
suggestions which gradually shaped and realized the
Scholarship idea. Mr. Stead tried, without success, to
persuade Rhodes to divide the scholarships between
Oxford and Cambridge, also to open them to women; he
was successful, however, in his suggestion which resulted
in scholarships being granted to the States and Territories
of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Rhodes rejected all propositions whereby the appointments
were to be based solely upon Competitive Examinations.
His own ideas upon this subject were
expressed in the Codicil of October, 1901.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Thus the form realized in the last Will and Testament
was not the result of any hasty resolution to attempt
some great innovation in the method of bequeathing
wealth for educational purposes; it was not a philanthropic
caprice; it was not a mere response to suggestions
occurring to him while casting about, as so often happens,
for an answer to the question, ‘How shall I leave my
money?’ Both the substance and the letter of the document
by which he left £2,000,000 for ‘an educational
experiment’ were the result of living and thinking, suggesting
and receiving suggestions, accepting and rejecting;
and, finally, of careful decision. It represents
conclusions; it is characteristic, moreover, of the mind
of its author, combining practical judgement with the
promptings of an imperial imagination; it represents
unbroken confidence in the ideals which to him made
life worth living.</p>

<p>Soon after the writing of this Will the Boer War broke
out, and the political concord between Rhodes and
Mr. Stead was at an end. Their friendship, however,
continued, and each remained true to the same old ideal—although
their opinions as to British rights in South
Africa were in violent antithesis.</p>

<p>In the original Will Mr. Rhodes left the residue of his
real and personal estate to the Earl of Rosebery, Earl
Grey, Alfred Beit, William Thomas Stead, Lewis Lloyd
Mitchell, and Bourchier Francis Hawksley, absolutely as
joint tenants. The same persons were appointed his
Executors and Trustees.</p>

<p>In a Codicil dated January, 1901, Rhodes directed that
the name of W. T. Stead should be removed from the
list of his Executors.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In October of the same year he
added Lord Milner’s name to the list of Executors and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
joint heirs, and in March, 1902, on his death-bed, that of
Dr. Jameson.</p>

<p>Before the month was out the great creative imperialist
had passed from the scene of his successes. He died at
Muizenberg, near Cape Town, on the 26th of March,
1902, in his forty-ninth year.</p>

<p>In his constructive fancy he had known no ordinary
limits. ‘I would annex the planets if I could.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He
had measured by more than the span of a single life or
a few generations; he had built for to-morrow as well as
for to-day. ‘I find I am human, but should like to live
after my death.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He frequently wished ‘that he might
return to earth to see how his ideas were prospering, and
what was being done with the fortune which he had
dedicated to the service of posterity’. His Will expresses
in concrete form what were his purposes and what
the plans which he left as a sacred Trust to the care and
guardianship of his chosen friends.</p>

<p>The Will is arranged in forty-two clauses, followed by
four codicils. As it is the intention here to deal only
with those provisions which bear directly upon the
Rhodes Scholarships or Oxford, it would seem natural to
omit all other articles; but, for the sake of giving a comprehensive
view of this remarkable document, it has
seemed preferable to follow the regular order of the
clauses, inserting summaries of those which are irrelevant
to our subject.</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">The Scholarships at Oxford.</span>]</p>

<div class="clarendon">

<p>16. Whereas I consider that the education of young
Colonists at one of the Universities in the United
Kingdom is of great advantage to them for giving
breadth to their views for their instruction in life
and manners and for instilling into their minds the
advantage to the Colonies as well as to the United
Kingdom of the retention of the unity of the Empire
And whereas in the case of young Colonists studying
at a University in the United Kingdom I attach very
great importance to the University having a residential
system such as is in force at the Universities
of Oxford and Cambridge for without it those
students are at the most critical period of their lives
left without any supervision And whereas there are
at the present time 50 or more students from South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Africa studying at the University of Edinburgh many
of whom are attracted there by its excellent medical
school and I should like to establish some of the
Scholarships hereinafter mentioned in that University
but owing to its not having such a residential
system as aforesaid I feel obliged to refrain from
doing so And whereas my own University the
University of Oxford has such a system and I suggest
that it should try and extend its scope so as if
possible to make its medical school at least as good
as that at the University of Edinburgh And whereas
I also desire to encourage and foster an appreciation
of the advantages which I implicitly believe will
result from the union of the English-speaking peoples
throughout the world and to encourage in the
students from the United States of North America
who will benefit from the American Scholarships
to be established for the reason above given at the
University of Oxford under this my Will an attachment
to the country from which they have sprung
but without I hope withdrawing them or their
sympathies from the land of their adoption or birth
Now therefore I direct my Trustees as soon as may
be after my death and either simultaneously or
gradually as they shall find convenient and if
gradually then in such order as they shall think fit
to establish for male students the scholarships hereinafter
directed to be established each of which
shall be of yearly value of £300 and be tenable at
any College in the University of Oxford for three
consecutive academical years.</p>

<span class="smaller">FROM PROVISION TO PRACTICE, 1902-1906<br>
THE MEASURES AND STEPS BY WHICH THE SCHOLARSHIP SYSTEM HAS BEEN ORGANIZED</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Cecil Rhodes had no idea that his Will was a perfect
document. He well realized the difficulty and the complexity
of the problem of organizing and putting in
practice the Scholarship system for which he was providing;
and with clear foresight he made the will elastic,
leaving to his Trustees and their agents the development
of details.</p>

<p>He had always in life expressed a rare confidence in
the Anglo-Saxon race. His Will bears witness to the
confidence which he placed in the training capacity of
the oldest seat of Anglo-Saxon learning, in the skill and
public spirit of his Trustees, and in the assimilative
capacities of a cosmopolitan group of students of Anglo-Saxon
stock whom he meant to draw together.</p>

<p>The first step for the Trustees was to secure agents
who should have personal supervision of the task of
organizing and engineering the machinery by which
Rhodes Scholars should be selected, introduced to Oxford,
and instructed, advised, and guided in the various intricacies
of what, to most of them, would prove an altogether
new system. Dr. George R. Parkin, LL.D., G.M.G., was
called from his position as President of Upper Canada
College, Toronto, and accepted and undertook the task
of ‘world agent’, so to speak, of the Rhodes Trust. His
wide experience in educational work, his knowledge of
Oxford as an Oxford student, and his intimate knowledge
of the parts of the British Empire and of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
English speaking world eminently fitted Dr. Parkin for
the position which he assumed.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis J. Wylie, M. A., a Fellow of Brasenose College,
Oxford, was chosen to fill an executive and diplomatic
position as the Oxford representative of the Trustees, a
position which makes him at once the negotiator between
the Trust and the University, and, until the Scholars’
applications for College entrance are adjusted and accepted,
between the Scholars and the University and Colleges.</p>

<p>To Dr. Parkin was entrusted the making of the necessary
arrangements with Oxford, and the construction of
a system for selecting and appointing Scholars. Negotiations
with the University and with the Colleges found all
the Colleges willing to accept Rhodes Scholars, although
their requirements varied somewhat. The Trustees found
it advisable to require that only men who showed ability
to pass Responsions<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> should be eligible.</p>

<p>Entrance to an Oxford College is not as simple a matter
as entering most Colleges or Universities in the United
States, Germany, the British Colonies or even other
Universities in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The handling of an endless variety of questions which
would naturally arise in this connexion, negotiations between
the appointed Scholars and Oxford, and the adjustment
of individual difficulties at Oxford became, as they
continue to be, the charge of Mr. Wylie.</p>

<p>Dr. Parkin was then able to set out on what became
a one-hundred-thousand-mile trip to the ‘ends of the
earth’, to approach the authorities in the centres from
which Rhodes Scholars were to be drawn. It was his
mission to deal with ever-varying local conditions, and
establish in each centre an appointive system which would
at once satisfy the requirements of the Will, the requirements
of the University, and the circumstances of the
local educational (and sometimes political) régimes. Only
through the elasticity of the Will, which gave discretionary
powers to the Trustees, and through which they,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
in turn, allowed Dr. Parkin to deal with local conditions,
was the success of these negotiations made possible.</p>

<p>Of this unique trip of organization Dr. Parkin says:—</p>

<p>‘Practically it has brought me in touch with almost
every educational man of weight in the United States
and in all our Colonies. In New York I met the heads
of fifteen of the greatest American Universities, and in
Washington the Presidents of the State Universities
throughout the Union assembled in conference. At
Boston the Colleges and Schools of New England were
represented. At Chicago nearly sixty heads of Colleges
from the six neighbouring States, representing altogether
between twenty and twenty-five millions of people, had
been drawn together by President Harper. At Atlanta
the nine Southern States were represented, the delegates
coming 600 miles southward from Virginia and 500 miles
northward from Louisiana. At Kansas City, Spokane,
San Francisco, and Denver, the representatives of the
Far West and the Pacific Coast were collected. In the
Maritime Provinces of Canada, at Montreal, Toronto,
Winnipeg, Regina, and Vancouver, independent conferences
were held, as also in each of the Australian States,
in New Zealand, Bermuda, Jamaica and Newfoundland.
In South Africa the consultation was chiefly with individual
schools or the heads of educational departments.’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>As may readily be seen from clause 23 of the Will,
Rhodes had in mind a system of selection which is only
possible to ‘Schools’ and to some Colleges which are
organized after the manner of the English ‘Public School’.
Obviously this system would be altogether inapplicable in
most parts of the United States and in the newer parts of
the British Empire. Clause 25, however, leaves to the
Trustees the right to make such arrangements and provide
such a system as shall be found practicable.</p>

<p>The questions, then, which these conferences had to
discuss were: the extent to which it was possible to
adhere to Rhodes’s suggestions; methods of selection;
the committees of selection; eligibility; age limits; conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of domicile; and school or collegiate standing
which should govern candidature and appointment.</p>

<p>The results were, broadly speaking, as follows:<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>—</p>

<p>In those Colonies where neither Governor nor Chief
Justice is elected or directly subject to political influence,
these officials were asked to act along with educational
men on the Committees of Selection.</p>

<p>In four of the Canadian Provinces and a few States
of the United States a system was agreed upon among
the leading Colleges or Universities whereby they were
to nominate Scholars in rotation. (This remains the case
only in Maine, Vermont, and Washington, and these may
soon be changed.)</p>

<p>Scholars from Cape Colony were of course chosen
from the individual schools to which Scholarships were
assigned.</p>

<p>Whenever the number of Independent Colleges or
Universities is large, and when courses of study vary
widely, it was found most practicable to adopt a plan of
open candidature.</p>

<p>Aside from those Committees in which the Governor
and Chief Justice were included, the Committee of Selection
were chosen entirely from among prominent educators.
The Presidents of the leading Universities are
chairmen or members of those Committees, and two,
four, or six, prominent University men of their respective
States or Provinces are associated with them. The constitution
of Committees in the United States has been
kept purely academic.</p>

<p>In Germany the appointment as provided by the Will
lies with the Emperor.</p>

<p>Age limits and preparatory training were absorbing
questions. The English boy ‘comes up’ to Oxford as
a rule in his nineteenth or twentieth year, after from
four to seven years in a ‘Public School’ such as Eton,
Harrow, Westminster, Winchester (or from a smaller
school with much the same academic system). The English
‘Public School’ (which is not a Public School at all,
see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>) differs widely in character and in curriculum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
from the American ‘High School’ or Preparatory School,
if we except a group of academic schools—nearly all in
the East—which are modelled on the English system.</p>

<p>It was therefore a question of prime importance to
what extent it would be necessary, and then how far
desirable and advisable, that the equipment of Rhodes
Scholars should approximate to that of their college-mates-to-be,
and in what respects they might advantageously
differ.</p>

<p>It was pointed out in the Conferences:—</p>

<p>That the English ‘Public School’ gives a boy an
opportunity to distinguish himself through its elaborate
system of athletics and scholarship examinations at an
earlier age than is usual in Colonial or American Secondary
Schools.</p>

<p>That the American or Colonial student after two or
more years of college or University life at home would
be much better fitted to enter Oxford without handicap
than if he went directly from his Secondary School.</p>

<p>That for the sake of understanding the English University
from the American point of view and the
American University from the English point of view,
likewise for understanding and comparing other institutions,
and above all for the sake of his later life when
he should return to live in his own country, he ought
to have a preliminary experience of University life in his
own country.</p>

<p>That in order to appreciate and make the most of the
advantages or opportunities which his position as a
Rhodes Scholar would offer him, and to avoid the temptations
to idleness to which Oxford would expose him
and the variety of temptations which the long Vacation
present, and in order that he might know, and remain in
thoughtful and intimate sympathy with affairs in his
own country, it would be greatly to his advantage to be
more mature than the average graduate of the Colonial or
American Secondary School, or than the ordinary Oxford
matriculant.</p>

<p>W. T. Harris, United States Commissioner of Education,
said in 1902:<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>—‘It would seem best that our candidates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
for the Rhodes Scholarships should all have
obtained a preparation amounting to that required for
the A.B. degree.’ The consensus of opinion, while not
going to that length, was that at least two years of previous
College or University life should be required, and
with few exceptions this was made the rule.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In cases where a Committee expressly asked leave to
appoint from Secondary Schools, leave was granted. (This
privilege has not been made use of.) Two years’ college
requirements were adopted for Canada, for four of the
six Australian States, and for New Zealand.</p>

<p>Three of the four South African schools to which
Scholarships were especially assigned, asked to be allowed
to send pupils who had pursued their work after leaving
school for at least two years at the Cape University.</p>

<p>Queensland, West Australia, Natal, Rhodesia, Newfoundland,
Bermuda, and Jamaica are the only Colonies
where two years’ University standing is not insisted on.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>This preliminary work of organization occupied Dr.
Parkin, beginning in the early Fall of 1902, for more
than a year. In the Spring of 1903 Mr. Wylie assumed
office in Oxford. In December, 1903, the Trustees issued
Memoranda to the Colonies and to the States, then to the
Committees of Selection; and through them prospective
candidates were informed of the conditions and regulations
which they must fulfil.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Seven South Africans and five Germans were appointed
to Scholarships in 1903, and, with one exception, these
men, the first Rhodes Scholars, entered Oxford in Michaelmas
Term of that year (Oct. 1903).</p>

<p>In March, 1904, Dr. Parkin arrived in New York<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
with a package of sealed envelopes which contained
the examination questions, prepared in Oxford to be
‘set’ in the United States and Canada for the qualifying
examination. On April 13, the first papers were opened
simultaneously at various appointed centres throughout
the two countries. The various sets of papers were
opened successively in the presence of the supervising
examiners as the hours of each examination arrived,
during that day and the next. In the United States
236 candidates took the examination, and in Canada 7.
When papers were finished the supervising examiners
sealed them, and the whole number were sent to Oxford,
there to be read and passed upon.</p>

<p>Of 242 who took this first examination 126 satisfied
the examiners.</p>

<p>The names of those who ‘passed’ were reported to
their Committees. From these lists the Committees then
made their selection. When more than one candidate
was eligible, the choice was to be based as far as possible
upon Rhodes’s suggestions as laid down in clause 23 of
the Will.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In 1904, 48 scholars were selected from lists of candidates
who had passed the examination; 19 Colonial
scholars were chosen without examination; five Germans
were also appointed.</p>

<p>The appointees were instructed to enter into negotiations
with Oxford Colleges, through Mr. Wylie, at once.</p>

<p>Candidates were, and are, of course, allowed a choice
in the matter of Colleges (students can only enter the
University through a College), and this is a matter of
considerable importance.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Owing to the lateness of certain
appointments, and owing to the difficulty experienced
in some quarters in getting sufficient information on
the requirements and on the characteristics of different
Colleges, there was some confusion, a good deal of
puzzling, and numerous cases of almost random choosing
in the expression of preference for this or that College,
and in the acceptance of applications by the Colleges.</p>

<p>In October, 1904, the first large group of Rhodes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Scholars, 72 in number, was matriculated at Oxford.
The two questions which most vexed the Rhodes Scholars
and the College and University authorities in that year
were that of ‘standing’ and that of ‘choosing a course’,
and these questions, while being simplified and made
easier of settlement, will remain as problems which will
confront the majority of foreign students who enter
Oxford, especially Americans.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In October, 1905, 67 more Rhodes Scholars arrived,
followed in October, 1906, by 28 more, there being for
1906 no appointments in the United States. In the
interval eighteen have ‘gone down’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and two have died.</p>

<p>The system of appointment, including Methods, Committees,
and Regulations, has required some alteration and
constant supervision—matters that occupy Dr. Parkin’s
attention. At Oxford, personal negotiation, introduction,
the adjustment of ever-rising individual questions, consultations,
suggestion and advice when sought, and—by
no means least—the issuing of quarterly cheques, are the
<i>technical</i> functions of Mr. Wylie’s office.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, have been the successive steps by which
the machinery has been set up and put in motion for
realizing the elementary stages of the Rhodes Scholarship
Scheme. By these means Rhodes Scholars have
entered—and some have already left—Oxford. At present
(January, 1907) there are in residence on the banks
of the Isis 158 students who, in the words of the late
Dr. Monro of Oriel, ‘benefiting by the munificence of
Cecil Rhodes, now come from distant colonies and from
nations joined to us by the tie of culture and of scholarship.’</p>

<p>The Rhodes Scholar enters Oxford, not as a ‘Scholar’,
but as a ‘Commoner’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; his relations and responsibilities
to the University are those of the ordinary undergraduate.
He has served his time as a ‘curiosity’, the Chancellor
has welcomed him, the Proctor has declared his approval
of his presence, the Examiners have been ‘satisfied’, and
the University has conferred degrees upon some of his
number. His ‘Rhodes Scholarship’ is ceasing to be
emphasized, and it is understood that it is his business
and his purpose to live the life, so far as is compatible with
his individual tastes, his character, and his principles, of
the ordinary Oxford student.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE APPOINTMENT<br>
ELIGIBILITY, REQUIREMENTS, QUALIFICATIONS, EXAMINATION,
METHODS OF SELECTION, METHODS OF PROCEDURE AND INSTRUCTION</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The Rhodes Trust now issues Memoranda which deal
with the regulations and instructions which govern the
eligibility and selection of candidates in their respective
centres. Information may be had from the Local Committees.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
A brief condensation of these regulations as
they appear at present will answer most of the technical
questions which may present themselves to a prospective
candidate.</p>

<h4>Eligibility.</h4>

<p>Candidates <i>must</i> be <i>subjects</i> of those countries which
they represent, i. e. Colonials—British subjects; Americans—citizens
of the United States; Germans—German
subjects.</p>

<p>Candidates must be unmarried.</p>

<p>Candidates must have passed their nineteenth birthday
(except: West Australia—seventeenth, Queensland,
Jamaica, and Newfoundland—eighteenth); but must not
have passed their twenty-fifth (Newfoundland—twenty-first,
South Africa—twenty-fourth) by October 1st of the
year for which they are elected.</p>

<p>Candidates, <i>except those who are exempted by the Colonial
Universities Statute or by special regulations (see, for various
States, Provinces, and Colonies, below)</i>, shall pass the ‘Responsions’
examination of the University of Oxford or its
equivalent before becoming eligible for election.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p><i>This examination is in no way competitive.</i> It is merely
a <i>qualifying test</i> to guarantee a degree of scholarship
which will allow a student to take up a course at Oxford.</p>

<h4>The Examination.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Papers.</div>

<p>At the request of the Trustees, the University of
Oxford named in 1904 and 1905 a Board of Examiners
to prepare and handle papers for this special examination.
The same method will be adopted in 1907, and probably
with little change henceforth. Papers are arranged in
Oxford, printed, enclosed in sealed packages, and sent
to the Chairman of each Committee of Selection. These
packages are opened by the supervising examiner at the
time and place announced for the examination and in the
presence of the candidates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Time and place.</div>

<p>This examination will be held each year (except in the
case of American, German, and South African scholarships,
as noted above on p. 24) in each State or Territory,
Province and Colony, not later than the month of
January, at suitable centres fixed upon by the respective
Committees of Selection. The Committees will appoint
suitable persons to supervise the examination and ensure
its impartial conduct.</p>

<p>Stationery will be supplied. The packets of papers
when opened will be found to contain the examination
questions, time tables, the printed text of classical passages,
&amp;c., which are set in questions. Therefore <i>no
textbooks will be required</i>.</p>

<p>The subjects and books assigned may vary slightly
from year to year. The requirements, however, are as
follows:<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>—</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <b>Arithmetic</b>—the whole.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <i>Either</i>, <b>The Elements of Algebra</b>—Addition, Subtraction,
Multiplication, Division, Greatest Common
Measure, Least Common Multiple, Fractions, Extraction
of Square Root, Simple Equations containing one or two
unknown quantities, and problems producing such equations;</p>

<p><i>Or</i>, <b>The Elements of Geometry</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Elementary questions, including propositions enunciated
by Euclid, and easy deductions therefrom, will be
set on the subject-matter contained in the following
portions of Euclid’s Elements, viz.:—</p>

<p>Book I. The whole, excluding propositions 7, 16, 17, 21.</p>

<p>Book II. The whole, excluding proposition 8.</p>

<p>Book III. The whole, excluding propositions 2, 4-10,
13, 23, 24, 26-29.</p>

<p>Any method of proof will be accepted which shows
clearness and accuracy in geometrical reasoning. So far
as possible, candidates should aim at making the proof of
any proposition complete in itself. In the case of propositions
1-7, 9, 10 of Book II, algebraical proofs will be
allowed.</p>

<p>The American student especially should note that
<i>arithmetic</i> includes <i>circulating decimals</i> and <i>English money</i>.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> <b>Greek</b> <i>and</i> <b>Latin Grammar</b>.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> <b>Translation from English into Latin Prose.</b></p>

<p><b>5.</b> <i>One</i> <b>Greek</b> <i>and one</i> <b>Latin book</b>.</p>

<p>Any of the following portions of the under-mentioned
authors will be accepted as a ‘book’:—</p>

<p>Demosthenes: <i>De Corona</i>.</p>

<p>Euripides (any two of the following Plays: <i>Hecuba</i>,
<i>Medea</i>, <i>Alcestis</i>, <i>Bacchae</i>).</p>

<p>Homer: (1) <i>Iliad</i>, 1-5 or 2-6; <i>or</i> (2) <i>Odyssey</i>, 1-5, 2-6.</p>

<p>Plato: <i>Apology</i> and <i>Crito</i>.</p>

<p>Sophocles: <i>Antigone</i> and <i>Ajax</i>.</p>

<p>Xenophon: <i>Anabasis</i>, 1-4 or 2-5.</p>

<p>Caesar: <i>De Bello Gallico</i>, 1-4.</p>

<p>Cicero: (1) <i>Philippics</i>, 1, 2; <i>or</i> (2) <i>In Catilinam</i>, 1-3,
and <i>In Verrem Actio</i> I; <i>or</i> (3) <i>Pro Murena</i> and <i>Pro Lege
Manilia</i>; <i>or</i> (4) <i>De Senectute</i> and <i>De Amicitia</i>.</p>

<p>Horace: (1) <i>Odes</i>, 1-5; <i>or</i> (2) <i>Satires</i>; <i>or</i> (3) <i>Epistles</i>.</p>

<p>Livy: Books 5 and 6.</p>

<p>Virgil: (1) the <i>Bucolics</i>, with Books 1-3 of the <i>Aeneid</i>;
<i>or</i> (2) the <i>Georgics</i>; <i>or</i> (3) the <i>Aeneid</i>, Books 1-5 or 2-6.</p>

<p>Candidates, in preparation, may save time by noticing
that <i>one</i> Greek and <i>one</i> Latin book <i>only</i> are required.
Translations <i>only</i> are required; no questions being asked
on the context or the grammar of the passages in the set
Books. <i>Greek and Latin Grammar and Latin Prose should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
be given special attention</i> for the separate papers set on
those subjects.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Texts.</div>

<p>The Texts used are the Oxford Classical Texts (so far as
published).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examination Papers.</div>

<p>The papers written by candidates will be collected
at the end of each examination, sealed, and sent to
Oxford, where they will be examined. The names of
those candidates who have satisfied the examiners will
then be listed and sent to their respective Committees,
and from these and the names of candidates who have
otherwise qualified the Committee will make a selection.
A certificate of having passed Responsions or of exemption
from Responsions holds good permanently, so that a
person once having obtained such certificates need not
take the examination again in order to qualify as a
candidate, and no holder of such certificate will be required
to take Responsions upon entering the University of
Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Selection.</div>

<p>Any questions of doubtful eligibility are to be settled
by the local Committee of Selection.</p>

<p>The appointment shall be made each year; not later
than the first of March in Australia and New Zealand;
not later than the end of March in the other States,
Territories, Provinces, and Colonies. The Scholar elected
will begin residence in Oxford in October of the year
in which he is elected.</p>

<h5>Jamaica.</h5>

<p>Candidates must have passed their eighteenth birthday,
the upper limit (25) remaining the same.</p>

<p>The parents or recognized guardians of candidates must
be actually domiciled in Jamaica, such domicile to include
at least seven years of residence in Jamaica immediately
preceding the election. In cases where, during the seven
years’ period, the parent or guardian has taken short
holiday trips off the island, such absence shall not be
counted.</p>

<p>Candidates must have passed at least five years of their
life in Jamaica. If educated partially abroad, candidates
must not have left Jamaica to commence such part of
their education before the age of eleven years, their
preliminary education having been secured in Jamaica.</p>

<p>Every third year the selection of the Rhodes Scholars
will be made from the candidates who have lived in
Jamaica for the whole of the seven years preceding the
date of examination. In case of such candidate having
been off the island for the benefit of his health during
this period, the Committee of Selection may decide, if
they think fit, that this does not interfere with his
eligibility. (Candidates who have attended a Colonial
University affiliated to Oxford are exempted from Responsions
if they fulfil the conditions of the Statute.) The
qualifying examination will be held in the city of
Kingston each year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<h5>Newfoundland.</h5>

<p>Candidates must have passed their eighteenth birthday,
but must not have passed their twenty-first birthday, on
the first of October of the year for which they are elected.</p>

<p>Candidates or their parents must have resided in the
Colony for the five years immediately preceding the
examination.</p>

<p>Candidates must have been regular attendant pupils or
teachers <i>in one of the public schools of the Colony for the
three scholastic years immediately previous to the examination</i>,
provided that in alternate years, beginning in 1905,
candidates who have received their education elsewhere
subsequent to their fifteenth birthday, and who are otherwise
qualified, shall be eligible.</p>

<p>The qualifying examination shall be held in the city of
St. John’s each year.</p>

<h5>New Zealand.</h5>

<p>Candidates must be either graduates of the University of
New Zealand or undergraduates of that University. They
must have been for five years immediately preceding the
year of election domiciled in the Colony, and must have
been educated in the Colony four of such years.</p>

<p>The University of New Zealand has applied for and
has been admitted to the privileges of the Colonial Universities’
Statute, so that candidates coming from that
University who have fulfilled the stated conditions are
accepted as candidates for Rhodes Scholarships without
further examination.</p>

<p>The qualifying examination will be held in the city of
Kingston each year.</p>

<h5>South Africa.</h5>

<p>Candidates must have passed their eighteenth, but not
have passed their twenty-fourth birthday on October 1 of
the year for which they are elected.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p><b>Natal.</b> (Additional Qualifications.) In Natal candidates
are required (1) to have been educated at a School or Schools
in the Colony of Natal for six years previous to the date of
election, or (2) to have their legal domicile in Natal for
six years, though acquiring their education or any part of
it in other Colonies of South Africa. The Committee of
Selection is free to make allowance at its discretion for
temporary absences from the Colony or from South Africa
during the six years referred to.</p>

<p>The Trustees desire to have assurances of full preparation
up to the Oxford standard of Responsions of all
Scholars elected by the four College Schools to which
Scholarships are assigned in Cape Colony.</p>

<p>To this end permission has been given to these Schools
to allow their elected Scholars, before taking up the
Scholarship at Oxford, to pursue their studies, for a limited
time after leaving school, at the higher institutions of the
Colony.</p>

<p>In view of existing educational conditions, leave is
occasionally given at present by the Trustees for candidates
for the Scholarships assigned to Rhodesia who are
being educated in other parts of Africa or in England to
compete, provided that their parents reside in or are
intimately connected with the Colony. In these instances
the candidate is allowed to take Responsions or its
equivalent either in England or in the Colony where
he is receiving his education. Application for leave to
compete under these conditions must be made to the
Trustees directly or through the Director of Education
for Rhodesia. Other things being equal, preference will
be given to candidates educated in Rhodesia.</p>

<h5>The United States of America.</h5>

<p>An elected scholar shall have reached, before going into
residence, at the least the end of his sophomore or second-year
work at some recognized degree-granting University
or College of the United States. An exception to this
rule is made in the case of the State of Massachusetts,
where, at the request of the Committee of Selection, authority
is given to appoint from the Secondary Schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>Candidates may elect whether they will apply for the
Scholarship of the State or Territory in which they have
acquired any large part of their educational qualification,
or for that of the State or Territory in which they have
their ordinary private domicile, home or residence. They
may pass the qualifying examination at any centre, but
they must be prepared to present themselves before election
to the Committee of Selection in the State or Territory
they select.</p>

<p>No candidate may compete in more than one State or
Territory either in the same year or in successive years.</p>

<h4>Selection.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></h4>

<p>In accordance with the wish of Mr. Rhodes, the Trustees
desire that<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> ‘in the selection of a student to a Scholarship
regard shall be had to (i) his literary and scholastic
attainments; (ii) his fondness for and success in manly
outdoor sports, such as cricket, football, and the like;
(iii) his qualities of manhood, truth, courage, devotion to
duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness,
unselfishness and fellowship; and (iv) his exhibition,
during school days, of moral force of character and of
instincts to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates’.
Mr. Rhodes suggested that (ii) and (iii) should
be decided in any School or College by votes of fellow
students, and (iv) by the Head of the School or College.</p>

<p>Where circumstances render it impracticable to carry
out the letter of these suggestions, the Trustees hope that
every effort will be made to give effect to their spirit, but
desire it to be understood that the final decision must rest
with the Committee of Selection.</p>

<p>As a separate memorandum is prepared for each of
several groups into which the scholarship system has been
divided, it is impossible to reproduce here all the details of
each. The following clauses are taken from the <i>Memorandum
issued for the United States</i>:—</p>

<p>To aid in making a choice each qualified Candidate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
should be required to furnish to the Chairman of the
Committee of Selection:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A Certificate of age (showing that he is within the
eligible limits of age).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A full statement of his educational career at School
and College, his record in athletics, and such testimonials
from his masters at School and his professors at College,
in reference to the qualities indicated by Mr. Rhodes, as
will assist the judgement of the Committee of Selection.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In cases where more than one Candidate from a
single School or College or University has qualified, the
School, College, or University should be required to select
(in accordance with the views of Mr. Rhodes) its chosen
representative to go before the Committee of Selection
for final choice, and a Certificate that he has been so
chosen shall be sent to the Chairman of the Committee
of Selection.</p>

<p>Each <i>Candidate should personally present himself to the
Committee</i> of Selection before a final decision is made,
<i>unless specially excused by the Committee itself</i>, in which case
a statement of the reasons should be sent to the Trustees.</p>

<p>If a careful comparison of these records and personal
interviews with the Candidates do not furnish sufficient
grounds for making a decision, the Committee of Selection
is free to apply to the Candidates, or to any selected
number of them, such further intellectual or other tests
as they may consider necessary (for purposes of comparison).</p>

<p>The <i>Chairman of the Committee of Selection</i> should at
once notify to the Trustees and to Mr. F. J. Wylie, The
Rhodes Trust, Oxford, the name of the elected Scholar,
and should forward to the latter all the records, credentials,
and testimonials relating to the Scholar on which the
election was made. These papers should be transmitted
<i>immediately</i>, as they are used in consulting College
authorities in regard to the admission of Scholars. It
has been the experience of the past two years that
Scholars have frequently been unable to gain admission
to any of the Colleges of their preference owing to
remissness in forwarding to Mr. Wylie the necessary
information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>The following ‘Instructions’, issued to Scholars elected
for the year 1905, indicate the course of procedure by
which a Scholar is entered at Oxford:—</p>

<p>‘1. In order to be admitted to the University of Oxford,
it is necessary to be first accepted as a member of one of
the Colleges which compose the University.</p>

<p>Election to a Rhodes Scholarship does not of itself
admit to a College.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Every College has its own standard
for admission, for Rhodes Scholars as for all other applicants,
and accepts or rejects at its own discretion. Moreover,
the number of Rhodes Scholars which any one
College will admit is strictly limited. Few Colleges will
admit more than five in any one year; and in the
majority of cases four is the maximum. From the
different candidates for admission a College will select
those whose records suggest that they are most likely
to do credit to the College to which they may belong.
It is therefore essential that, in applying for admission
to a College, a Scholar should submit the fullest possible
evidence as to his personal character and academic record.</p>

<p>‘2. The procedure for a Scholar-elect should be as
follows:—</p>

<p>(1) <i>Immediately</i> on receiving notice of his election he
should write to the Oxford Secretary to the Rhodes
Trustees, Mr. F. J. Wylie, The Rhodes Trust, Oxford,
stating in order the Colleges which he prefers.</p>

<p>(2) He should satisfy himself that the credentials
which he submitted to the Committee of Selection have
been forwarded by the Chairman to Mr. Wylie.</p>

<p>(3) He should himself forward <i>to Mr. Wylie</i> any portion
of the following information which may not have been
included in the documents submitted to the Committee
of Selection:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A Certificate of age;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Testimonials as to character;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Certified evidence as to the Courses of Study
pursued by the Scholar at his University, and as to
the gradings attained to by him in those Courses. This
evidence should be signed by the Registrar, or other
responsible official, of his University;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A Catalogue of his University;</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Evidence as to the general tastes and pursuits of
the Scholar outside his Academic Course;</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Information as to the intentions of the Scholar in
regard to the line of study he proposes to follow at
Oxford.</p>

<p>It is also desirable that the Scholar should state to
what religious denomination he belongs.</p>

<p><i>All this material must reach Mr. Wylie</i> by the beginning
of the Summer Term—that is, <i>by the middle of April at
the latest</i>.</p>

<p>‘3. When Mr. Wylie has the necessary information in
his hands he will attempt to secure for each Scholar
admission to the College of his preference. That will
not be always possible. When a Scholar fails to gain
admission to the College which stands first on his list
of preferences, Mr. Wylie will enter into negotiation
with the College second on that list, and so on.</p>

<p>Where he is specially requested to do so, Mr. Wylie
is prepared to select a College for a Scholar, but it is
greatly to be preferred that each Scholar should, so far
as possible, choose for himself.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payment of the Scholarship.</div>

<p>The Scholarship will be paid quarterly. The first
payment (£75) will be made in the course of the first
week of the Michaelmas Term (October). No request
for any earlier payment can be considered.</p>

<p>After a Scholar has been once accepted by a College
he should conduct all further correspondence as to
residence, studies, &amp;c., directly with the College in
question.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> A Scholar must arrive in Oxford not later
than the day on which his College assembles; and it
will in most cases be advantageous to arrive a few days
earlier.</p>

OR AS IT HAS SEEMED TO A RHODES SCHOLAR</span></h3>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of describing Oxford.</div>

<p>What manner of place is Oxford? Every one knows
Oxford; and yet, how little is Oxford understood—even
by those who enjoy a period of residence within its gates!
Tourists come for a day or a week, ask numerous questions,
consult a guide or a book, see a few buildings and a picture
postcard, and are ready to tell ‘all about Oxford’. Yet
the longer one stays in Oxford the more one hesitates to
attempt description.</p>

<p>The University has its ‘Statutes’, its ‘Handbook’, its
‘Calendar’, its ‘Examination Statutes’, its ‘Programmes’
and ‘Lecture Lists’, which contain the official information
which an American inquirer expects to find in
his University ‘Catalogues’, ‘Bulletins’, and ‘College
Annuals’. Then there are numberless books which deal
with various phases of Oxford life, some of them serious,
some merely impressionist sketches. But no one book
professes to give a really comprehensive description of
Oxford or to touch on all its phases; few persons have
time or opportunity or inclination to read all; and still
fewer, after reading of Oxford or living in Oxford, or
doing both, agree in their impressions of what Oxford
<i>really</i> is.</p>

<p>Oxford changes slowly, very slowly—and yet what one
writes of Oxford to-day may seem inaccurate to his readers
to-morrow; Oxford mills grind exceeding fine, yet what
one person thinks wheat may seem to another chaff. It
depends on the point of view. This is where the difficulty
lies, and herein one feels his presumption when trying to
make Oxford real and comprehensible to the uninitiated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two ideas: the abstract and the concrete.</div>

<p>Really ‘Oxford’ means two things—it is the name of
a place, and it represents an idea. Bonaparte said of
himself that he was ‘not a man but an event’, and yet
he was both. The word ‘Napoleon’ represents to us
a <i>man</i> and an <i>idea</i>. The difficulty is to differentiate, to
say how far the concrete and the abstract may be
separated, and how far each is necessary to the proper
understanding of the other. The technical purpose for
which these chapters are intended suggests that this
attempt to outline certain salient features of Oxford
custom and practice shall be limited to the concrete,
avoiding as far as possible the ideal side, especially where
bordering on the lines of controversy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxford. Unique character.</div>

<p>Oxford is unique among Universities. Only Cambridge
approximates to it in character and in system. No other
English or Continental University is like these two. It
is from its manner of life and from its environment
that Oxford has acquired and maintained its individuality.
The University has a history which by tradition antedates
the Conquest; it has grown with England; its rights,
its charters, its laws have undergone the vicissitudes of
centuries and have developed in the same process of
evolution with the charters and laws and Constitution
of England. The Colleges have been intimately associated
with the great events, constitutional, political, religious,
and social, which have made English history; and the
University has fought for and won its rights side by side
with other English institutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">National position.</div>

<p>As it exists to-day the University is ‘sovereign’ within
its own borders, subject to the National Government
only in regard to those greater obligations, such as an
individual State in the United States owes to the National
Government.</p>

<p>Oxford and Cambridge are not National or State
Universities in the sense in which that term is applied
to many Continental and American Universities. The
English Government makes <i>no appropriation</i> for their
support. And yet they are—and they only—in character
the great national Universities of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The University a federation.</div>

<p>Visitors from abroad come to Oxford, are shown about
through College after College, and after many expressions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of surprise and delight exclaim, ‘Yes, yes; excellent,
excellent, but where is the University?’ They are
looking for the ‘main building’, the ‘administration
building’, something concrete which they may call the
University—and they do not find it.</p>

<p>The University is a federation—an academic United
States, made up of twenty-two ‘societies’—the Colleges—each
of which has its separate corporate existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revenues.</div>

<p>The University is dependent for its running expenses
on its endowments, fees, and the <i>pro rata</i> contributions
from each of the Colleges. The Colleges are also supported
by their endowments, which, usually in land, are
considerable and yet decidedly variable, and also by
College fees as paid by undergraduates. The University
is not as rich in income as credited, and its yearly
revenues are really insufficient for the enormous work
which it undertakes.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Expense.</div>

<p>There are a number of reasons why the cost of living
at Oxford is high. The University, as explained, consists
of a large number of separate establishments—the
Colleges. Students are ‘up’ but one half of the year,
and yet the College ‘establishment’ must be maintained
the year round. A large number of servants are necessary
to the system, which in respect to style of living and
service resembles hotel life. The standard of maintenance
and service demanded by the students themselves is not
conducive to economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The student body.</div>

<p>It is somewhat misleading to characterize Oxford and
Cambridge as ‘rich men’s Universities’. The phrase is
probably more appropriate to them than it is to any
other English-speaking educational institutions; yet
‘wealth’ is not the key to entrance or to success in
Oxford. So far as technical restrictions are concerned,
the University is open ‘without respect of birth, age, or
creed to all persons who satisfy the appointed officers
that they are likely to derive educational advantage from
its membership’.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In practice a considerable amount of ready cash is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
necessary for every one who wishes to enjoy the advantages
of Oxford College life.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The sons of aristocratic
and of well-to-do families in England, if destined for
University careers, are nearly all sent to Oxford or to
Cambridge, and the student bodies are recruited largely
from these sources. It is asserted that Oxford draws
a large proportion of its students from some twenty
‘Public Schools’. The boys who go through these
‘Schools’ have had most of their education away from
home since their ninth or tenth years. The cost of living
in an English ‘Public School’ is as great as, or greater
than, that of educating a boy in an American Private
Preparatory School or ‘Military Academy’. Men who
have been in these Schools usually come up to Oxford
with a generous allowance.</p>

<p>But there are also in Oxford a large number of men
whose means are comparatively limited. There is no
such thing as ‘working one’s way’ in Oxford, and practically
the only way in which one’s allowance may be
supplemented is through the winning of a scholarship.
The type of student who under Western conditions in
America not infrequently ‘starts his College career on
nothing and graduates with a bank account’ is impossible
in Oxford. Again, while it is true that many men in
Oxford consider themselves ‘absolutely poor’ on a sum
which will keep a man in most Universities altogether
comfortably, yet for all purposes of comparison there
is an inconsiderable proportion of poor men in the
University.</p>

<p>Oxford life <i>is</i> expensive—in many respects it <i>seems too</i>
expensive. A high minimum allowance<a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> is necessary to
the student, just as some knowledge of Latin and Greek
is necessary for passing Responsions; but it is as misleading
to characterize the whole institution as a ‘rich
man’s University’ as it would be to say the whole student
body is composed of scholars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Democratic character.</div>

<p>Within itself the University is very democratic. The
lines of social cleavage are rather vertical than horizontal.
There is a thorough atmosphere of personal independence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
While peculiarities and eccentricities are discouraged, yet
originality—so long as it does not annoy—is at a premium,
and individuality is sacred to an extent best known to
Englishmen. The diversity of interests and the variety
of pursuits in which Oxford men are daily engaged cover
almost as wide a range as the catalogue of individual tastes.</p>

<p>With all this diversity of taste and pursuit, the students
within the University commonwealth are alike in this,
that, whether from noble, aristocratic, or middle-class
families, they generally represent achievement and
ambition—and <i>most</i> of them regard their University
course as a training for active political, professional,
literary, or social life. Oxford and Cambridge claim pre-eminently
to fit the men, who by reason of birth or merit
succeed to the leading places in British administration
and thought, for the high places which they are to fill.
As Wellington gave credit for the victory of Waterloo to
the ‘playing-fields of Eton’, so England gives credit for
innumerable triumphs, military, civil, and political, for
achievements, physical, intellectual, and moral, to the
playing-fields and the river, the lecture-rooms and the
firesides of Oxford. The University boasts that it trains
men to live lives both of achievement and of enjoyment,
to meet exigencies and emergencies as they arise—to be
not only men but gentlemen. Oxford and Cambridge
degrees are accepted in England as educational hall-marks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social.</div>

<p>Clubs and cliques and social discriminations, of course,
exist, but they are little paraded. One’s social relations
and activities are little known outside the circle to which
they appertain. There is a rare freedom from ‘’Varsity
Politics’. Athletic professionalism is an absent quantity.
Oxford neither knows nor understands the spirit of the
German student <i>Verbindung</i> or of the American ‘College
Fraternity’. In fact many phases of the ‘fraternizing’
spirit seem lacking in Oxford life.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to the ‘Class organization’ or
organization by Departments which influences University
life in America, is the predominance of the College in
Oxford life. Clear lines between ‘Senior’, ‘Junior,’
‘Sophomore,’ and ‘Freshmen’ are not drawn; there are
no Class organizations and Class activities—such, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
instance, as football matches, cane-rushes, editing the
College Annual, and the ‘Junior Prom.’ There is some
natural separation but no artificial cleavage between
students of different years. The relations between a
‘Fresher’ and a ‘Second year’ or ‘Third year’ man,
for instance, are subject to certain conventions and formalities
of introduction which Oxford emphasizes only in
their practice, but, beyond that, social relations are only
limited by one’s own personality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conservatism.</div>

<p>To say that Oxford is Conservative is almost to state
an axiom. The ‘town’ is Conservative; the University
is Conservative; the students are Conservative. Conscious
of this characteristic, Oxford cultivates it to some
extent as an ideal. Pointing to history, and emphasizing
results, it justifies Conservatism, yet its Conservatism
should not be magnified. The town, rejoicing for the
present in the artistic inconvenience of horse-cars and
some other like antiquities, nevertheless continues a study
and a discussion of motor-trams and motor-’buses, and
will doubtless some day adopt that form of conveyance
which it decides best. Likewise the University, feeling
a certain prejudice against innovations and a certain suspicion
of new methods and practices, looks with a critical
eye upon new theories, new educational ideas and suggestions,
and yet it is generally ready to appropriate and to
apply those productions of modern thought and genius
which prove themselves, by surviving the experimental
stage, really worth while. Oxford Conservatism is essentially
a thinking attitude. In the realm of politics,
‘Socialism’ as it is commonly cried in many of the Continental
Universities, is tabooed in Oxford. ‘Conservatives’—and
every Oxford man has his politics—outnumber
‘Liberals’, although not by any great majority. Oxford
has seldom stood for other than Tory principles; and yet
one has not far to look in English history to see how time
and again reform movements and the promulgation of
new and radical ideas have originated and found their
support in ‘the Universities’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comfort.</div>

<p>Oxford would not be English if it did not emphasize
comfort—personal comfort. True, it has many inconveniences
and lacks some of the fittings which add to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
perfection of modern buildings. It is hard to reconcile
old buildings and modern conveniences. Lamp and
candle still shed the only light in at least one College—but
this is not the rule; nearly every College building in
Oxford has been ‘wired’, and table-lamps as well as
drop-light ‘switch on’ in student rooms at the ‘press
of the button’. Modern baths and showers (except a few
new buildings) and a University gymnasium are wanting;
but every man has his ‘tub’; and the gymnasium ‘though
missing is not missed’—for all outdoors is the Oxford
gymnasium. For boxing, wrestling, and fencing there
are private gymnasiums.</p>

<p>But for the solid everyday comfort of well-furnished
apartments, of good cooking and excellent service, for
freedom from bother with details, for convenient arrangements
for athletic sports and for social life, Oxford provides
as by a high art. The ‘strenuous life’ is frequently
better known by its absence than otherwise, and many
people in Oxford dislike even the sound of those words;
yet there is a clear track and every opportunity for the
man who insists on being strenuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artistic surroundings.</div>

<p>Added to the personal comforts are the artistic and
scholastic comforts—if one may speak of them as such—with
which the student is surrounded. The natural
beauties of Oxford’s environment are a fit setting for the
classic treasures of architecture which have risen in
irregular grouping throughout the mediaeval town. As
the student comes and goes, as he sits at his lecture, he
is, consciously or unconsciously, living in an atmosphere
of artistic realities. And then again, one cannot but
remember now and then that he is sitting on the same
benches or writing at the same table where once sat
or wrote many of the men whose lives or whose works
he is set to study, and whose portraits now stare down
upon him from the walls opposite or whose coats of arms
are blazoned on the oak panelling around him. Then as
for books and libraries and reading-rooms—whether one
wishes to dig among ancient texts or manuscripts, to
consult reference libraries, or to fill one’s own shelves
with books old and new, where can Oxford be surpassed?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cosmopolitanism.</div>

<p>As a cosmopolitan intellectual centre Oxford is a Mecca<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
to which pilgrims flock from all parts of the world;
pilgrims with brains, pilgrims without brains; those
who want to learn and those who do <i>not</i> want to learn;
bookworms, athletes, soldiers, ‘sports,’ workers and
idlers; sons of noblemen, sons of commoners; not
Englishmen alone, but Indians, Japanese, Chinese, Russians,
Egyptians, Germans, and Frenchmen. All this
variety of student units go about looking very much
alike in the conventional ‘lounge’ garb of Oxford; so
that only an intimate acquaintance reveals the true
cosmopolitanism of its personnel and of its intellectual life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘College’.</div>

<p>Although the University encircles, and, in constitutional
and jurisdictional matters, exercises authority over
the Colleges, it is really only the sum of the Colleges,
each of which is in turn only the sum of its members.
While the University is thus only a union of
the Colleges for attaining such ends and such status
as can better be attained by united than by isolated
existence, the College is a real and concrete thing, the
foundation stone of the ‘Oxford System’. Each College
is within itself independent; each has its own traditions
and some characteristics of organization, life, and system
which are peculiar to itself. With the affairs of the
College individually the University is not concerned.</p>

<p>The Colleges as they exist to-day suggest some features
of the monastery, some of the ancient hostelry, some
of the fashionable hotel, some of the College dormitory,
and some of the bachelor’s club—they combine church,
lecture-rooms, dining-halls, professors’ houses, College
clubs and students’ apartments, all within the radius
of College walls, all accessible only through College gates,
all capable of being shut off from the outside world,
at once castle and prison.</p>

<p>To the University there come each year about 900
new men: there are in residence about 2,800; of these
each College has from 40 to 300. During his first and
second year the student is generally required to live
in College, while in his third he may (except in a few
instances) and often <i>must</i> go out into ‘digs’, that is, into
‘licensed lodgings’ in the town.</p>

<p>The life of the College is real Oxford life. It was this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
which Cecil Rhodes cherished most in his reverence for
his University; it was this which gave him his confidence
in the ‘Oxford System’.</p>

<p>As with individuals so with these Colleges—the longer
one’s acquaintance, the better one realizes that each
College is independent, has its individuality, its own
traditions, and its own personal character. This makes
College life again a difficult subject upon which to
generalize. Certain technical characteristics, however,
are common to all. The College buildings are arranged
in quadrangles, in each of which are several ‘stairs’.
On each stair are a number of suites of rooms, eight
suites being perhaps the average. There are no corridors,
so that each stair is as it were a house by itself. Each
student has rooms to himself, a ‘sitter’, which serves
as living and dining room, and a ‘bedder’ always; while
often a ‘thirder’ adds the convenience of a separate
study-room. Each suite has also a small cupboard-pantry,
and there is usually on each stair a ‘scout’s
pantry’ (or kitchen). Each stair has a ‘scout’ and one
or two ‘scout’s boys’, who are servants-in-general to all
the men on the stair.</p>

<p>The system of breakfasting, lunching, and entertaining
in one’s rooms makes the undergraduate at once a host
and a householder. When at rare intervals a student
wishes to be left alone with his books or his thoughts
he may ‘sport his oak’, that is, he may slam the heavy
oaken outer door, well known to readers of <i>Tom Brown</i>,
whose inside spring-lock bars entrance even to friends
who may be familiar enough to ignore the suggestion of
its closing. The great elasticity of the tutoring and
examination system further makes it possible for the
undergraduate to study or not as he may choose, and
to dispose of his time practically at his own sweet will.
In these respects the Oxford student enjoys an independence
which is almost unknown elsewhere—excepting
in some of the German Universities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Oxford day.</div>

<p>As the activities of Oxford readily resolve themselves
into scholastic, athletic, and social, so the Oxford day,
the natural Oxford day, in respect to morning, afternoon,
and evening, approximately adopts this order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>Voluntary early rising is not the fashion, but eight
o’clock chapel or roll-call compels it on half, or more
than half, the days of Term, while the demands of
training prevent many men from sleeping as late as
their less strenuous fellows. As compared with American
students, however, on their native soil, the Oxford student
is a late riser. The voice of the scout and the slamming
of a bath-tub on the floor rouse the student to a consciousness
of the new day. Morning hours begin invariably
with a cold tub. Chapel, if attended (ritual service only),
requires about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Breakfast is taken in one’s own rooms or in the rooms
of a friend, alone, or with three or four friends or guests—for
the breakfast hour is a favourite time for entertaining,
and enjoying a social meal. An Oxford ‘brekker’
is very different from the coffee and rolls of the Continent—it
is a good, hearty meal, with satisfying solid courses.</p>

<p>Most lectures are given between nine and one o’clock.
These four hours, more than any others, are Oxford’s
<i>formal</i> work-time, while the hours from eight in the
evening on are those also given to work.</p>

<p>Luncheon, if the student lunch in his rooms or in the
College Common-room (only possible in a few Colleges),
is a very light meal. But luncheon, again, is a favourite
medium for entertaining, especially on Sundays, and
when one has guests, luncheon loses its ordinarily simple
character.</p>

<p>It requires a more or less elaborate system, especially
in a large College, to provide for and keep up with the
wants of two or three hundred tables. The cooking is
all done in the College kitchen, and from there are sent
the dishes which the student orders through his scout.
Milk, bread, cheese, ‘drinks,’ and so forth are supplied
by the College buttery; cakes, candies, fruits, tea, coffee,
and tobaccos are usually obtained from the College
‘Common-room’—all are sent to the ‘stair’, and the
scout serves the tables upon the stair. Every student
has tea and coffee and sugar, and usually a shelf full of
such edibles and drinkables as he chooses, together with
dishes and ‘plate’ in his pantry. A kettle of water is
usually boiling, or ready to boil, on the trivet before his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
fireplace, so that he is always prepared to dispense a
substantial as well as a cordial hospitality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athletics.</div>

<p>The afternoon is given up to sport. Oxford students
probably give more time to athletics than any other body
of students in the world. At Heidelberg, aside from
a few sporadic efforts on the river, the most strenuous
exercise indulged in seems to be on the blood-stained
floor of the duelling-room in the ‘Hirschgasse’, but less
than half the students indulge in this energetic crossing
of swords. The French students scarcely understand the
term ‘athletics’ at all. America and England lead, and
although the American College has a good deal of
athletics, and sometimes too much, it is athletics for
the minority, whereas at Oxford almost everybody ‘goes
in for something’.</p>

<p>The students come from that class which can and does
take the greatest interest in all manner of sports and
athletic games. In the ‘Public Schools’ the boys learn
the rules and requirements of their games, and get about
all the coaching they ever get. Men do not often <i>learn</i>
games at the ’Varsity; they play them. ‘Practice’ is
a word little heard on a College field; only in rowing
is a systematic and an evolutionary coaching-system in
practice.</p>

<p>Each College has its own boats, its own football and
cricket and hockey teams, with its own playing-fields.
There is a constant programme of inter-college contests.</p>

<p>The Oxford idea is ‘exercise for every one’, a thing of
vital importance for keeping in condition in the climate
of Oxford. Exercise is taught the English boy with his
A, B, C. Of the 2,800 students who keep Term at
Oxford, fully two-thirds are out engaging in some
vigorous exercise every afternoon. For games, it is not
requisite that one be a ‘star’—every one may find room
at something or other. The men who show up best in
their College teams or in College crews are ‘tried’ for
the ’Varsity. Thus the ’Varsity teams and crews are
chosen from a <i>very large number</i> of men who are actually
engaged in and practising the sports for which ’Varsity
men are needed, and under this system athletic ability
is often discovered which, under systems where only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
‘promising candidates’ ever ‘try’, would never even be
suspected.</p>

<p>The game more than the victory is the objective in
College contests,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and although this may rob the play of
a certain intense strenuousness, it at the same time
eliminates roughness and foul play.</p>

<p>With the exception of rowing, systematic coaching
and serious training are little applied. At times, this
causes a decided lack of that efficiency which results
from precise ‘team-work’, and may be criticized as
leaving too much to the brilliancy of individual playing;
but it eliminates professionalism and trickery.</p>

<p>There is little business connected with College athletics.
The expenses of field and pavilion and barge and boats
are met from subscriptions to the ‘amalgamated clubs’—to
which nearly every College man belongs. The expenditure
of a team is slight. The College provides the
field. Every man furnishes his own ‘togs’, of which
a different sort are required for nearly every sport. The
clubs furnish boats and balls, and the few requisites
which must be common property. Only to ’Varsity
matches (and not to all of them) is admission charged.
Almost no one watches a College match, for the simple
reason that every one who is not playing on the field
is engaged somewhere else at some other game. There
is no ‘rooting’. A few scattered cheers break out at
times, but there is no organized ‘encouragement’. One
feature of Oxford athletics which is in striking antithesis
to American College athletics is, that here, the more
prominent and successful an athlete becomes, the greater
his expenses, as he buys his own outfits, his own ‘blazers’,
often pays his own railroad fares, usually incurs numerous
social obligations, and receives no ‘compensation’ further
than a row of shining prizes which may adorn his mantle-shelf.</p>

<p>From the river and fields the men come in at about
4.30 for tea. Years ago a German traveller wrote in
his diary, ‘To the Englishman tea is as necessary as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the German his beer.’ The customs have not changed.
In this respect as in others ‘Oxford is nothing if not the
reflection of English life’. As a social institution the
tea-hour, with rest and ‘something to eat’ and lively
conversation ‘after the game’, is thoroughly enjoyable;
while as a practical institution it is a necessity, as dinner
is two and a half hours away and the inner man needs
immediate fortifying after the vigorous exercise of the
past two hours.</p>

<p>The hard-working man, then, has a chance to get in
two hours of reading between tea-time and dinner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evening.</div>

<p>After the bells have struck seven the students stream,
in gown and bare-headed, toward their College halls. At
this one time during the day the students of each College
really gather in a body. In the semi-gloom of the long
hall, with its high ceiling and panelled, portrait-hung
walls, with fireplaces glowing and electric lights illumining
white cloths and bright silver, the tables are arranged
in long rows, with flanking of narrow, backless benches
on each side. Students file in; dons and Master enter,
in evening dress, their loose gowns flowing back from
their shoulders as they stride to ‘high table’. After
the reading of a <i>Benedictus benedicat</i> all sit down and fall-to
right merrily. The dinner hour can hardly be styled
a social hour—in hall; in fact, so business-like does it
become at certain undergraduate tables that it might well
appear to the casual observer——but, as a matter of fact,
casual observers are not allowed entrance.</p>

<p>After dinner the men gather in little knots about the
bulletin-boards or drift into the Common-room, there in
the College club-rooms to spend a few minutes over the
newspapers, writing notes, consulting the bulletins,
athletic reports and predictions, or engaging in conversation
over coffee-cups and a quiet smoke. Or little groups
go off to this or that room for ‘coffee’ and a social hour
or evening; while many go straight away to libraries or
work-tables.</p>

<p>The possible divisions for the evening are too numerous
for even a summary; but of the serious possibilities there
are numerous debating and literary societies in every
College. There are University Clubs, literary, musical,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
social, political; the Union Debates, parliamentary in
their training, occur every Thursday evening; on Sunday
evenings the Balliol Concerts provide excellent programmes
of music, open to undergraduates; under town
auspices and under University auspices, Oxford is given
opportunity throughout Term-time to hear much of the
best musical talent; visits and addresses by the leaders
of English political and ecclesiastical thought are frequent,
and are thoroughly appreciated by the undergraduate
body.</p>

<p>An attempt to describe the difference between the
activities of one Term and another would lead too far
afield. Three times each year the men ‘come up’, spend
eight weeks in Oxford, and go down again for the three
Vacations, which last six, six, and sixteen weeks respectively.
No small amount—in the case of many men the
major portion—of the student’s ‘work’ is done during
these Vacations. To some men the Vacation is the ‘dull
season’ and Term-time is play-time; to others Term-time
is a season for filling up notebooks and Vacation
a time for learning what has been written into them.
To some the object of life seems to be reading; to others,
athletics and sports in general. There is no ‘dull season’
in Oxford athletics. Football, hockey, lacrosse, &amp;c., are
played in the two winter Terms; rowing goes on the
year round, as does track practice; tennis, cricket, and
the ‘slacking’ forms of river exercise are favourites in
the Summer Term. The Oxford-Cambridge Rugby match
is played in the Christmas Vacation; the Oxford-Cambridge
Boat-race and the field sports take place in the
Spring Vacation. The pleasures of Oxford Summer
Term, ‘Eights week,’ ‘Commem.,’ and Henley, lead to
the realm of poetry and have no place in a handbook.</p>

<p>Some critics complain that men waste their time in
Oxford. So they do, <i>some of them</i>—and so they do elsewhere.
It is all a matter of manner and degree, and
a question of what constitutes waste. One might do
almost no work in Oxford and yet do just the opposite
of wasting his time—if he use his eyes and ears. There
is that about Oxford which breathes of History, which
exhales Romance, which is redolent of culture, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
fills the very atmosphere with the spirit of hospitality.
One need only walk through the College ‘quads’ and
cloisters, follow the windings of the ‘finest architectural
street in Europe’, ‘the High,’ wander through meadow
and park, along the banks of Isis and Cherwell, through
Addison’s Walk, through ‘Mesopotamia’, or out on the
hills where Shelley delighted to pass long afternoons, or
off to the north where Gladstone walked alone; one
must, if he have any capacity, get something of a liberal
education; he cannot fail of inspiration. One may go to
lectures on Literature and History, and, without ever
taking a note, carry away impressions of what <i>has been</i>
and what <i>is</i> and what <i>is going to be</i> in the world, especially
in the English world, and in life and thought both
ancient and modern.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell some one else just what Oxford
<i>is</i>—but Oxford <i>as it <span class="smcap">may be</span></i> is a question with which
every Oxford man has to deal for himself. Oxford is
a home of ‘influences’; it is all too frequently referred
to as the ‘home of lost causes’; what it becomes for each
man who trusts himself or is entrusted to its ‘influence’,
depends largely upon himself. The University offers
each man wide fields for the investment of his time and
talent—it offers much for one to learn—but it does not
do much choosing for one, nor does it set itself as a
task-master.</p>

<p>It is often hard to take Oxford seriously. Examinations
seem a far-away, hazy something, too often forgotten, as
each day unrolls a tempting programme of delights other
than books. Unlimited credit causes many an unthinking
undergraduate to step deep into debt before he stops to
reflect that tradesmen <i>do</i> keep accounts. The freedom
of a life where every man is expected to think and act
for himself offers every opportunity for self-improvement
or self-destruction. But there is always a day of reckoning.
Sooner or later examinations stare one in the face
and bills roll in from every side. The student has kept
his Terms and Oxford has offered him what he has
chosen to take. The man who has reckoned well with
his time and his money will take something far more
valuable than his degree from Oxford. The man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
has looked upon his ’Varsity years as a mere summer of
pleasure has also gotten much out of his ‘College course’,
but in its last days he may find much cause to quote
from the ‘grasshopper and the ant’.</p>

<p>The <i>University Calendar</i> for 1906-7 shows a total of 3,663 undergraduates
at present enrolled.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE OXFORD SYSTEM<br>
UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE GOVERNMENT, METHODS OF
INSTRUCTION, COURSES OF STUDY, DEGREES</span></h3>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The point of view.</div>

<p>Some one has said that a University, primarily considered,
is less a school than an atmosphere. This applies
with peculiar force to Oxford. Unlike American or German
Universities, Oxford aims not primarily to provide instruction,
but rather to provide an atmosphere for the
many-sided Oxford life. For centuries, Oxford has been
the training school of the English gentleman. It stands
pre-eminently for culture and good breeding, for a liberal
education in the widest and best sense, not merely the
knowledge that comes from books, but especially and
above all for the knowledge of men and affairs. It is the
difference between a training to make a living and a
training to make a life, to put the best <i>into</i> life rather
than to make the most <i>out</i> of it. The highest Oxford
ideal is the scholar <i>and</i> the gentleman, but the gentleman
first of all. A faithful reflex of English society, Oxford
reflects its most marked characteristic conservatism. Yet
underneath this stratum of healthy conservatism runs the
current of twentieth-century life. Hence its uniqueness,
its complexity, its paradoxes. Conservative by force of
tradition and custom, Oxford breathes the liberal and
tolerant spirit of the twentieth century; exclusive and
aristocratic, the Oxford life is nevertheless very democratic;
open to all, Oxford is not for all people; faithful
to her heritage of the Past, Oxford is still a leader in the
Present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘system’.</div>

<p>Yet, oddly enough, from the undergraduate’s point of
view, the University is practically a thing apart, an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
abstract intangible something which touches the life of
the well-behaved ‘undergrad’ only at examination time,
that is to say, twice during his Oxford career, or on that
more ceremonious occasion, ‘degree-day.’ The uninitiated
stranger, searching for information in the <i>Student’s Handbook</i>,
is told that the ‘University is a body corporate
invested with all the usual powers of corporations and
also with various peculiar privileges, such as the right of
exercising jurisdiction, civil and criminal, over its members,
the right of returning two representatives to the House
of Commons, and the power of conferring degrees’. Not
a word about the teaching Faculty of the University or
about courses of study. Instead, an institution whose
main function, as far as the student is concerned, is to
hold examinations and to confer degrees. Further inquiry
leads to the College. The collegiate system, both in
regard to undergraduate life and undergraduate instruction,
is the counterpart to the more formal functions of
the University. Here is a dualism between College and
University unknown to most foreign students,—each
a separate, independent unit, a University existing side
by side with twenty-one corporate Societies, each leading
an independent existence, and yet most intimately connected
with one another. If an attempt is here made to
sketch this complex and intricate system in its barest
outlines, it is with a full realization of the difficulties as
well as at the risk of saying much that is obvious. The
background must be filled in by the reader from the
remarks made in the preceding chapter on the Oxford
life. The point of view of the prospective Rhodes Scholar
has been kept in view throughout, all unnecessary details
or obscure and ambiguous terms being, as far as possible,
avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University government and administration. Vice-Chancellor, Proctors.</div>

<p>The acting head of the University is the Vice-Chancellor,
the office of Chancellor being purely honorary. The
Heads of the several Colleges are nominated by the
Chancellor to the Vice-Chancellorship in order of rotation,
each holding office for a period of four years.
Assisted by the two Proctors, originally the heads of the
two ‘nations’ of mediaeval Oxford, the Vice-Chancellor
exercises a general supervision over all University affairs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
It is the Vice-Chancellor who presides at all the meetings
of the governing bodies of the University. He also enjoys
extensive judicial powers. The University occupies a
peculiar position not only in relation to its own members,
but to the city of Oxford as well. In most criminal as
well as in all civil cases, the University has the right to
try its members before its own court, popularly called
the Vice-Chancellor’s Court. The Vice-Chancellor, ably
assisted by the two Proctors—for in the eyes of the
undergraduates this is their most conspicuous function—is
responsible for the maintenance of order and discipline.
No public entertainment, for instance, can be held in
Oxford without the consent of the Vice-Chancellor and
of the Mayor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Convocation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Congregation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hebdomadal Council.</div>

<div class="sidenote">‘Statuta.’</div>

<p>The constitution of the University of Oxford rests on
a much wider basis than that of most American or Colonial
Universities. All graduates who have kept up their
connexion with the University through their respective
Colleges, whether resident in Oxford or not, and who have
taken the degree of Master of Arts, have a voice in the
government of the University, constituting the body
known as <i>Convocation</i>. It is the members of Convocation
who elect the two University representatives in the House
of Commons. The majority of these graduates are not
in residence at Oxford, so that in actual working practice
and under normal conditions Convocation is almost
identical with <i>Congregation</i>. This body is composed of
all resident members of Convocation, together with certain
<i>ex-officio</i> members. The ordinary routine of University
government is transacted by means of standing Committees
of Congregation, known as <i>Delegacies</i>. All
University legislation must originate with and in the
<i>Hebdomadal Council</i>, no proposition can even be discussed
by the large governing bodies of the University unless
sanctioned by a majority of the members of this Council.
This consists of the three executive officers of the University
and eighteen other members elected by Congregation,
six each from the Heads of Colleges, University
Professors, and University graduates—Masters of Arts—of
at least five years’ standing, respectively. A new
statute framed by the Council is then ‘promulgated’ in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Congregation, where it may be rejected or passed with or
without amendment. If passed by Congregation, the
statute is submitted to Convocation, which must confirm
or reject the measure in toto; it cannot amend.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It may
be said, in passing, for the benefit of those who are
labouring under the impression that reform from within
is impossible at Oxford, that, strange as it may seem, the
non-resident graduates are often, if not generally, the
most conservative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The College.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Admission.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Non-Collegiate Delegacy.</div>

<p>Entirely separate from the University in its corporate
life and existence, yet federally incorporated in the larger
University body, are the twenty-one Colleges or ‘Societies’
of Oxford. Each of these twenty-one States of this larger
Academic United States is an independent unit, a self-governing,
self-sufficient corporation, with its own traditions,
and its own history. The ‘Fellows’ of the College
elect their own Head; Christ Church as a Cathedral
Chapter is an exception, the Dean of Christ Church being
appointed by the Crown. Each College has its own
endowments and its own property; each fixes the conditions
for admission to membership in the ‘Society’,
each is responsible for the discipline and conduct of its
members, and provides for their instruction and general
welfare. No one can become a member of the University
unless he has been previously admitted to some College
(or to the body of Non-Collegiate Students). Most Colleges
require candidates for admission to pass an entrance
examination, practically the equivalent of the first University
Examination, known as ‘Responsions’. Rhodes
Scholars, in virtue of having passed the qualifying examination
for the Scholarship, are excused from all other
entrance examinations. Four Colleges—Balliol, University,
New College, and Corpus Christi College—will
admit only those candidates who intend to read for
Honours. It is as a member of some College (or of the
Non-Collegiate body) that a College-man becomes a
member of the University, and it is the higher degree of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Master of Arts, conferred by the University upon the
graduate who has kept up his connexion with his College,
which confers upon him also the privilege of sharing
in the government of his Alma Mater as a member of
Convocation. Recently, there has been established what
is known as the ‘<i>Non-Collegiate Delegacy</i>’. This approaches
in organization and administration an ordinary Oxford
College. But there is this great difference—Non-Collegiate
students do not live within College walls, but in
lodgings in the city, much on the American or German
plan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Residence.</div>

<p>For the attainment of the ordinary University degrees
there are certain requirements of residence and scholarship.
These requirements emphasize the two most conspicuous
features of the Oxford system, features which
most clearly reflect the dualism between the University
and the Colleges, viz. residence within College walls,
with all that this means—the Collegiate system,—and
the distinctively University function of holding examinations
which lead to University degrees; the responsibility
for providing the necessary facilities and instruction for
passing the examinations resting in the main with the
individual Colleges. It is the College which must see to
it that all its members who are candidates for University
degrees have satisfied, first of all, the statutable residence
requirements, and then that they are prepared to meet
the examination requirements of the University. No
candidate, even though he may be able to pass all the
necessary examinations with success, can take his degree
without the necessary residence as a member of a College
(or of the Non-Collegiate body). This suggests again the
great stress laid on the larger aspect of an Oxford education,
the great value of the larger Oxford life as described
in the preceding chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University Terms.</div>

<p>For all practical purposes the academical year consists
of three Terms of eight weeks each:—</p>

<p>1. Michaelmas Term,—beginning on the first Monday
after October 10.</p>

<p>2. Hilary or Lent Term,—on the first Monday after
January 14.</p>

<p>3. Easter and Trinity Term,—kept continuously as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
one Term, beginning on the second or third Monday after
Easter Sunday, according as Easter falls late or early.</p>

<p>For degree purposes, however, Easter and Trinity Terms
are reckoned separately, so that <i>four University Terms</i> go
to make up a year of residence (or standing).<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>These University Terms may be still further reduced.
Michaelmas and Hilary Terms may be kept by a residence
of forty-two days respectively; Easter and Trinity Terms
by residing twenty-one days in each Term, or forty-eight
days in the two Terms conjointly.</p>

<p>Residence, or, in the words of the statute, ‘<i>victum
sumendo et pernoctando</i>,’ is no longer confined to living
within the College walls. Candidates for University
degrees may under certain conditions ‘pernoctate’ in
lodgings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lodgings.</div>

<p>The Rhodes Trustees have decided that every Rhodes
Scholar shall reside in College for at least the first two
years at Oxford, except in cases where the College is
unable to offer him rooms. At the end of two years of
residence in College, Rhodes Scholars who have either
taken an Oxford degree, or who are of ‘mature age’ as
defined by University regulations, i. e. twenty-five years
or over, may, with the permission of the College authorities
and the consent of the Rhodes Trust, live in <i>unlicensed</i>
lodgings during their third year. All others who cannot
satisfy one of these two conditions are required to live in
<i>licensed</i> lodgings, which are under the direct supervision
of University authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Degrees.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Possible to Rhodes Scholars.</div>

<p>The University of Oxford grants degrees in Arts,
Music, Medicine (Surgery), Law, and Divinity, to which
must be added the recently instituted ‘research’ degrees
in Letters and Science. Special advanced courses, extending
over a year or two, are offered in Education,
Geography, Public Health, Economics, Anthropology,
Mining and Engineering, and Forestry, for which a
certificate or diploma, but no <i>degree</i>, is granted. We are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
concerned here only with those degrees which are possible
to the Rhodes Scholars. As has already been stated, all
candidates for an Oxford Bachelor’s degree (except the
degree in Music) must satisfy certain requirements of
residence and scholarship. The degrees which will be
open to the Rhodes Scholar who remains in Oxford <i>only</i>
for the three years of his Scholarship are:—</p>

<p>1. <i>The ordinary Bachelor of Arts</i> degree,—which, except
on certain conditions, requires twelve University Terms
of residence, i. e. three academic years; and</p>

<p>2. The more advanced, or ‘post-graduate’, <i>degrees</i> of
<i>Bachelor in Letters</i>, <i>Science</i>, or <i>Civil Law</i>,—which can only
be taken, upon satisfying certain preliminary qualifications,
after a residence of at least eight University Terms, i. e. at
the end of the second year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Standing.’</div>

<p>To proceed to the higher degrees, there are no further
requirements of residence, but only of <i>standing</i>. This
consists in keeping the name on the books of the College
whether resident or not, and paying the quarterly dues
to the University. In practice it amounts to paying a
nominal sum annually to the College, which pays the
University dues for the candidate for higher degrees.
This is technically known as keeping Terms of standing.</p>

<p><i>Master of Arts.</i> This degree can be taken only by an
Oxford B.A. upon entering on his twenty-seventh Term
from matriculation, i. e. after six and a half years. There
are no further requirements of scholarship.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><i>D.Litt.</i>, <i>D.Sc.</i>, <i>D.C.L.</i> Candidates who have taken the
Bachelor’s degree in Letters or Science may proceed to
the Doctorate in the twenty-seventh Term from the date
of their matriculation. Bachelors of Civil Law cannot
take the degree of D.C.L. until the expiration of five
years from the time of their admission to the B.C.L. In
any case, all candidates for the Doctor’s degree in Letters,
Science, or Civil Law are required to submit a dissertation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
which has contributed to the advancement of knowledge
in their particular field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advanced standing.</div>

<p>The University grants advanced standing, Junior or
Senior, to students from Colonial and Foreign Universities
upon certain conditions which are prescribed by Decree in
respect of the individual Universities.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Students from these
Universities or Colleges enjoy the following privileges:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Junior standing.</div>

<p>Any Undergraduate who has pursued a course of study
extending over at least two years at some recognized
University or College, and who becomes a candidate for
Honours at Oxford, is allowed to take his degree of
Bachelor of Arts at the end of his <i>eighth</i>, instead of the
<i>twelfth</i>, Term of residence. As far as the Rhodes Scholars
are concerned, Junior standing merely reduces the necessary
residence requirement from three to two years, and
exempts from no University examinations except Responsions
(including the ‘Additional Subject’).<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Senior standing.</div>

<p>Three years of study, with final Honours, at some recognized
University or College, is demanded as the necessary
qualification for Senior standing. This exempts from
Responsions <i>and</i> the <i>Intermediate Examination</i> (including
the Holy Scripture Examination),<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and reduces the necessary
residence requirement for the B. A. in some one of the
Honour Schools to two years. A Rhodes Scholar, therefore,
who has been granted Senior standing is required to
take <i>only</i> some Final Honour Examination, and may take
his degree at the end of his second year.</p>

<p>Students from other than Affiliated or Privileged Universities
may make application for advanced standing.
Each case will be considered on its own individual merits,
on the evidence of scholarship furnished by the applicant
as well as on the general standing of the College or University
from which he comes. If his claims are approved,
he is admitted to the same privileges as students from the
Affiliated or Privileged Universities. All such applications
should be made through the proper authorities of
the applicant’s Oxford College, and as early as possible.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Certain Colonial students exempted from the qualifying Examination.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘Rhodes examination’ exempts from Responsions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Oxford System.</div>

<p>Students of Affiliated <i>Colonial</i> Universities or Colleges,
who satisfy the conditions for advanced standing prescribed
by the particular Oxford Statute for their respective Universities
or Colleges, are excused from the qualifying
examination held by the Rhodes Trust for the Rhodes
Scholarships. At present all Candidates for Rhodes
Scholarships in the <i>United States</i> are required to pass this
examination, though it is probable that a similar exemption
will soon be granted to students of Privileged
American Universities. All Rhodes Scholars are accepted
by Oxford Colleges and by the University without further
test, the qualifying examination for the Scholarship being
accepted by the University of Oxford as the equivalent of
‘Responsions’, the first University examination.</p>

<p>Less than a half-century ago, the collegiate system
was still supreme; it was to the College, that the undergraduate
looked for ‘nutrimentum spiritus—et corporis’.
There was but little University teaching and no University
life. The examination system—introduced in
1805—was gradually raising the standard and requirements
of scholarship. But for a few Professorial lectures,
the University did practically nothing to provide for the
teaching of its members; it merely conducted examinations
and granted degrees. With the widening bounds
of knowledge, and the incorporation of new subjects in
the University Examination Statutes,—and especially
with the successful invasion—despite Ruskin’s defiance
of ‘Science’ and the scientific spirit, the inevitable duplication
of instructors and the consequent necessary increase
in College expenditure made the need of a closer and
more effective organization of the teaching body more
and more imperative. One of the first steps in this
direction—which also marked the first encroachment on
the old collegiate system—was the establishment in
1877-82 of the new University Professorships and the
extension of the University Museum and scientific laboratories.
This was followed by the large development of
the system of inter-collegiate lectures and by the appointment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
of University Professors and of lecturers and tutors
from other Colleges to assist in the tutorial and lecture
work of the separate Colleges. These developments have
overcome most of the serious defects of the decentralization
of the collegiate system of teaching, felt in the lack of
continuity or in the unavoidable overlapping of lecture-courses,
as well as in the duplication and the inadequacy
of the instructional force at any one College. They have
provided the material out of which is being gradually
evolved and organized a ‘graduate School’. In the closer
relations between University and College, and in this
more effective organization of the teaching body, Oxford
is approaching the American and the German systems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of courses.</div>

<p>Before giving a brief sketch of Oxford methods of instruction,
it will be well to warn those unfamiliar with
the system against certain very natural but entirely erroneous
ideas and misconceptions on this subject. First of
all, there is at Oxford no sharp line of division between
undergraduate and post-graduate work. A Bachelor’s
degree in Arts (Honours), Letters, Science, or Civil Law
can hardly be compared with an American B.A. or B.Litt.
The requirements for the ordinary Bachelor’s degree in
the Honour Schools are very high and rigid; all work is
concentrated along one definite line. ‘Specialization’,
as generally understood, is not an apt designation of the
course of study. There is a very considerable amount of
general reading to do—much of it in private and during
the Vacations—of which the examination requirements
hardly give an adequate idea. And while method, <i>as
method</i>, is not particularly emphasized or taught, some of
the original sources in the field of work are studied, and
thorough scientific work is done in the laboratories. An
Oxford (Honour) B.A. therefore represents much more
than mere routine undergraduate work. The work for
the degree of Bachelor in Letters, Science, or Law may
be fairly described as the equivalent of ‘post-graduate’
work. Thorough research, a dissertation or a special
course of advanced study, followed in the case of the
degree in Law by a very difficult examination, written
and viva voce, are required, and a very high standard is
set. One of the first ideas of which a Rhodes Scholar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
must disabuse himself is that the path to an Oxford
Honour degree is smooth and easy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pass and Honour courses.</div>

<p>Another point must be emphasized. The ordinary and
traditional course of procedure of an Oxford ‘Freshman’
is to register for the B.A. degree. But this is not all.
He must decide whether he will read for the Pass or the
Honour examination. In the former, there is only one
standard, and there are no limits of standing within which
the course of study must be completed. The Pass-man
comes up to Oxford to live the social life, to take advantage
of all its many opportunities for self-improvement,
self-culture, self-development, and, incidentally, to acquire
a modicum of knowledge. The man reading for ‘Honours’,
on the other hand, naturally has to meet much higher
requirements for the examinations. His success is
measured by his place in the ‘Class Lists’, those who have
passed the examination being distributed into three or
four ‘Classes’, each representing a different level of merit.
Furthermore, the Honour-man cannot take his examinations
at his leisure. No one who has exceeded a certain
number of Terms reckoned from his matriculation is
admitted to the examination.</p>

<p>In all cases, however, candidates for any Bachelor’s
degree (except occasionally for the ‘research’ degrees),
will find the system of instruction the same. This consists
partly of lectures, University or College, and partly
of personal tuition, provided by the College. All work,
whether it be lectures or work done for and with the
Tutor, is governed by, and planned to meet, the requirements
as fixed by the Examination Statutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lectures. System.</div>

<p>All lectures are sharply divided into ‘Pass’ and
‘Honour’ lectures, and are designed to meet the requirements
for Pass or Honour examinations. Most ‘Pass’
lectures are delivered by College Lecturers and Tutors for
members of the particular College only (no members of
other Colleges being admitted). ‘Honour’ lectures, however,
are practically open to all members of the University,
under the new system of inter-collegiate lectures. Both
University Professors and Lecturers and College Lecturers
and Tutors deliver Honour lectures, University and College
lectures being practically merged in one system. The distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
between Professorial and College lectures has become
one of origins only; in practice, it has been almost
obliterated. Occasionally, Professors give a series of
‘Public Lectures’, that is, lectures open to the general
public as well as to members of the University.</p>

<p>Lectures, however, are not the most important part of
the system. The best and most telling work is done
privately under the Tutor’s direction. There is no
‘credit’ or ‘hour’ system; there are no ‘required
courses’. Strictly speaking, attendance at lectures is not
compulsory. Theoretically, it is even possible to take an
Oxford degree without attending a single lecture. However,
as all lectures are based on, and intended to meet,
the examination requirements, undergraduates find it
advisable to attend those lectures which will be of use
for the ‘Schools’—the final examinations. Few men go
to more than ten lectures a week, and after passing the
intermediate examination the average tends to become
even less. Since the introduction of inter-collegiate
lectures, a well-organized system of lectures has been
made possible, especially in the Classical and Modern
History work, Theology, and Mathematics, together with
very complete and efficient private tuition. Due largely
to the expense involved, as well as to the character of the
teaching required, the University provides for most of
the instruction in Theology, Law, Natural Science, and
Medicine.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tutor.</div>

<p>Perhaps the most characteristic and salient feature of
the Oxford system is the personal tuition, the private and
informal teaching, which each College provides for its
members. On admission to the College, the newcomer
is assigned to a Tutor under whose guidance and supervision
he is to pursue his studies, not only during Term-time
at Oxford, but also during the Vacations. The
conscientious Tutor gets to know his protégé intimately,
his strong and his weak points; he can gauge accurately
and justly his qualities, capacities, and possibilities; he is
in a position to recognize and to provide for his particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
needs. The personal equation is here all-important.
The strongest point in the system may be at once the
source of its greatest weakness. A few sober-minded,
persistent, and strenuous individuals may achieve moderate
success despite an incapable Tutor. On the other
hand, a strong, sympathetic, and conscientious Tutor may
often work wonders with unpromising material.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The method.</div>

<p>An Oxford man ‘reads’ for his degree. This is characteristic.
Much as depends on the Tutor, in the last
resort the student is dependent on himself—on the
‘reading’ he does privately. The Tutor is merely an
adviser and a guide; there are disciplinary rules, to be
sure; but there are no final grades at the end of each
Term’s work, and there is no actual compulsion. A man
may do much or he may do little—that will depend
entirely upon himself. This is ‘his business’, and so
long as he conducts himself properly, the Tutor has
practically no means of constraint, except to remind the
student of the Damocles’ sword in the shape of the
University examinations. The whole system is based
on individualism—on a free and easy relationship between
Tutor and taught. It is conscientious individual
effort under capable and sympathetic supervision that
leads to success in the final examinations—‘the Schools’.
The Tutor advises the student to attend certain lecture
courses; he suggests certain books for private reading,
the result of which is generally embodied in the form of
an essay, or essays, to be read to the Tutor once or twice
a week. The Tutor makes his comments and criticisms,
and an informal discussion almost invariably follows, not
always restricted to the subject in hand. Whatever may
be said of ‘reading for the Schools’, it is a powerful
factor and incentive in the cultivation of the reading
habit, apart from the literary atmosphere of Oxford, which
of itself fosters general reading for the sake of self-culture.
Moreover, the academic year is very short—less than six
months. The Oxford man is therefore obliged to do the
bulk of his reading at home, during the Vacations which
make up more than half the year—a striking contrast to
the American or German programmes. The Tutor’s
work and influence is not restricted to the eight weeks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of Term-time, so largely given up to the amenities of life.
A certain amount of well-planned reading is assigned or
suggested for the Vacation. This again, however, is not
‘required reading’. There is no compulsion. Under
such a system the responsibility resting on the individual
undergraduate himself is only too evident, and is keenly
felt. The lectures being purely formal, it is in his College
rooms or at home that he does his reading, his writing, his
thinking. It is to the Tutor that he looks for guidance,
advice, and inspiration. It is in ‘the Schools’ that his
scholarship, the results of his private reading, of the
weekly essays, of ripe reflection and solid thinking, are
tested. With only two University examinations in the
course of his three or four years at Oxford, the training
of the memory means more than mere memorizing.
There is no opportunity of finishing each Term’s work
in succession, and forgetting during the next what has
been painfully acquired in the preceding Term. It means
training the judgement and the powers of reflection, introducing
unity and consistency into the mass of acquired
facts and of contradictory points of view, assimilating it
all, making it a part of one’s self. ‘Reading for the
Schools’ has its limitations and its dark side, but the
best products of the tutorial system may well challenge
comparison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The teaching staff.</div>

<p>Each College has its own teaching staff of Tutors and
Lecturers. It is, of course, impossible for the ordinary
College Tutor to supply instruction in all the various
fields of knowledge. The difficulty has been met by
appointing members of the instructional force of other
Colleges, and very frequently also University Professors
and Lecturers as College instructors, who in this way
become responsible for some part of the ordinary College
tuition. Thus it happens that an instructor may be lecturing
as University Professor or Reader on one day, and
on the next in his capacity as College Lecturer. By
means of this closer organization of the teaching force,
together with the system of inter-collegiate lectures, the
tuition supplied by each College is very complete. Many
of the College Tutors have their own special field of
work, or are engaged in research; but most of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
time is given in this free personal intercourse with the
students entrusted to them, which, begun perhaps at a
breakfast table, has come to mean much more than the
mere professional interest of a far-away instructor to his
wards. If Oxford has been reproached for a lack of the
scientific spirit and the spirit of research, a very just and
adequate reply may be made in the words of a present-day
Oxford Tutor, that ‘the energy which elsewhere goes
entirely to the advancement of knowledge is with them
(the Tutors) largely devoted to the training of character’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘The Schools.’ University Examinations.</div>

<p>At American and at most Colonial Universities, the instructors
and lecturers are at the same time the examiners.
There is generally a final examination in each subject or
course of lectures at the end of each Term or semester;
no further tests in the particular subject being required
for the University degree. At Oxford the examiners are
an entirely separate body of University officials, chosen
directly or indirectly for a period of two or three years,
for the most part from among the instructional staff—University
and College—in each field or subject. Since
the introduction of the examination system in 1805, the
constant addition of new subjects and the growing demands
of scholarship have built up a very complex and
intricate system of examination requirements. These are
published each year as the <i>Examination Statutes</i>, which
rigidly define the field to be covered in each case, and in
which special books, as well as works for general reading
and reference, are suggested. ‘Reading for the Schools’
has undoubtedly been one of the most serious obstacles
to the growth of Professorial and other advanced lectures
which have no direct bearing on, and which are not
intended to meet, the demands of ‘the Schools’; it has
also discouraged the spirit of research and the demands
for training in scientific method. However, it has the
advantage of promoting thoroughness and accuracy as
a result of concentrated and steady, persistent effort
along a definite line of work, <i>non multa sed multum</i>. The
standard of scholarship is high. Great stress is laid on
ease and facility of expression, on the ability to form
independent judgements, on originality. No one can get
a ‘First’ in the Class Lists on mere hard work and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
‘grinding’, or by a display of erudition and an imposing
array of facts. The examination papers are really a series of
essays. The examination generally consists of written
papers, followed some days or weeks later by a ‘viva voce’
examination. In Science, practical laboratory tests are
required. The strain of the examinations—especially in
the Final Honour Schools—is very severe. The examination
in ‘Greats’—i. e. in the School of Literae Humaniores—consists
of thirty-three hours of paper-work on six
consecutive days. There is very little opportunity for
‘cramming’, as physical fitness is a most important
factor. It is quite a general custom for candidates to
‘go down’ for a week’s rest before undergoing the ordeal
of ‘Exam. week’. Informal examinations—‘collections’—are
held in most Colleges at the beginning of each
Term by College tutors and lecturers to test the progress
their students have made during Term-time, as well as
the reading they have done or ought to have done during
the Vacation. These examinations, however, in no way
directly affect the student’s final grade. Everything
depends on the result of the University examinations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elective studies.</div>

<p>Rigid as the examination system appears to be, it is
yet very elastic. Not only has the candidate to choose
one of the many avenues leading to a degree—no one has
yet succeeded in calculating the total number of permutations
and combinations which can be made to lead to
a degree at Oxford—but he has abundant opportunity for
election from a wide range of subjects required for the
particular ‘School’ chosen. Moreover, all work for the
B.A. degree—lectures, tuition, and examinations—is
sharply divided into ‘Pass’ and ‘Honour’ work, and the
course of study pursued will naturally depend on the
student’s own choice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University Examinations for the B.A.</div>

<p>All candidates for an Oxford B.A. degree, apart from
satisfying the residence requirements of three years or
more, are obliged to pass certain University examinations,
viz. (1) Responsions, (2) an Intermediate Examination,
as a part of which is generally taken the examination
in Holy Scripture; and (3) a Final Examination.
The University accepts as an equivalent for Responsions
the qualifying examination which every American candidate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
for a Rhodes Scholarship is required to pass.
There remain for the Rhodes Scholar, therefore, only the
Intermediate (including Holy Scripture) and the Final
Examinations. As the work for these is sharply divided
into ‘Pass’ and ‘Honour’, four alternatives present themselves:—</p>

<p>Advanced degrees for which an Oxford B.A. is a necessary preliminary:—M.A.,

<p>Advanced degrees for which an Oxford B.A. is <i>not</i> a necessary preliminary:—B.Litt.,
B.Sc., B.C.L.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>To take (<i>a</i>) the Pass Examination in both the Intermediate
and the Final School;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Pass Examination in the Intermediate and
Honours in the Final School;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Honour Examination in <i>both</i> the Intermediate
and the Final School;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The Honour Examination in the Intermediate and
the Pass in the Final School.</p>

<p>While under no compulsion to take any degree, the
Rhodes Scholar reading for the B.A. degree is expected to
take Honours at least in the Final School. That is
to say, he is confronted with a choice between the second
and third alternatives just mentioned. To state it more
simply, he may take <i>either</i> the Pass <i>or</i> the Honour Examinations
in the Intermediate; he is expected to take
Honours in the Final School.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Intermediate Examination, Pass School.</div>

<p>To take up first of all the Intermediate Examination in
the <i>Pass</i> School. This may be <i>either</i> what is known as
‘Pass Moderations’, <i>or</i> the Preliminary Examination
in Jurisprudence, <i>or</i> the Preliminary Examination in
Natural Science. Pass Moderations will admit to the
Final Examinations in all of the nine Final Honour
Schools except Natural Science, and is required of those
reading for Honours in English Language and Literature.
For all the other Final Schools, except the School of
English Language and Literature, a candidate may qualify
by passing <i>any one</i> of the three Intermediate Examinations
just mentioned. A glance at the chart on p. 77
will perhaps make this a little clearer. The Law Preliminary
Examination is generally taken by men who
intend to read Jurisprudence, frequently also by candidates
for Honours in the Modern History School. The
‘Science Preliminary’ is seldom taken except by men
reading for the Final Examination in Natural Science.</p>

<p>The requirements for these three <i>Intermediate Pass</i>
Examinations are as follows:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Pass Mods.’</div>

<p>‘<i>Pass Moderations</i>’ is along the lines of ‘Responsions’,
the first University examination,—but of a more difficult
grade. The subjects are:—(1) translations from certain
prescribed Classical authors with questions on the text
and contents, (2) Logic <i>or</i> Algebra and Geometry, (3)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Latin Prose Composition, and (4) Unprepared Translations
in Greek and Latin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Law Prelim.’</div>

<p>The subjects of the Preliminary Examination in Jurisprudence
are:—(1) English Constitutional and Political
History after 1485, <i>or</i> European History, 800-1494; (2)
Gaius, <i>Institutes</i>, Books I and II to be read in the <i>original</i>,
with reference to the history and sources of the law;
(3) Unprepared Latin Translation; (4)(<i>a</i>) Logic, or Bacon’s
<i>Novum Organum</i>, Book I, <i>or</i> (<i>b</i>) a portion of a prescribed
Greek, French, or German author, with unprepared
translations in the language offered. Greek is optional,
but a fair knowledge of Latin is required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Science Prelim.’</div>

<p>The subjects of the Preliminary Examination in
Natural Science will depend on the candidate’s choice
of subjects for the Final School in Natural Science.
Examinations are held in (1) Mechanics and Physics,
(2) Chemistry, (3) Animal Physiology, (4) Zoology, and
(5) Botany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Additional Subject.’</div>

<p>Candidates who take either the Law or the Natural
Science Preliminary Examination are further required to
pass in an ‘Additional Subject’, additional, i. e., to the
Stated Subjects for Responsions. The examinations may
be in the nature of translations from (1) a prescribed
Greek or Latin, (2) French, German, or Italian author, or
on (3) Book I of Bacon’s <i>Novum Organum</i>, or (4) Elementary
Logic. This Additional Subject may be taken
any time after matriculation; except that it must be
taken before the student enters for the Law Preliminary
Examination, and it must be passed before any candidate
is admitted to the Final Examination in Natural Science.</p>

<p>All candidates who have passed in the written papers
in any one of the three Intermediate <i>Pass</i> Examinations
must undergo a ‘viva voce’ examination in the subjects
offered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Honour Mods.’</div>

<p>Instead of taking one of these three Pass Examinations,
the more ambitious and scholarly <i>may</i> decide to take
Honours in the Intermediate Examination—‘Honour
Moderations.’ This examination is of more than average
difficulty and requires thorough and conscientious preparation.
The candidate must be prepared (1) to translate
any passage set from Homer and Virgil and from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
orations of Demosthenes and Cicero; (2) he must choose
for special study at least three authors from a list of eight
Greek and eleven Latin authors, and be prepared to
answer questions on the text, contents, style, and literary
history. (3) A fairly difficult Latin Prose Composition is
set, also (4) unprepared translations in Greek and Latin,
and (5) a general paper, covering the field of Greek and
Latin grammar, literary criticism, and classical antiquities
in general. In addition there are certain optional subjects,
which may mean a better place in the ‘Class Lists’.
Great importance is attached to the literary character and
the style in which the examination papers are written.
There is no ‘viva voce’ examination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Honour Maths.’</div>

<p>Those who wish to escape the Classical part of ‘Honour
Moderations’ may take instead the Intermediate Examination
in ‘Honour Mathematics’ and an ‘Additional
Subject’, although this is not often done. The subjects
to be offered are (1) Algebra, (2) Trigonometry, (3) Pure
and Analytical Geometry, (4) Differential and Integral
Calculus, (5) Elements of Mechanics of Solids and Fluids.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examination in Holy Scripture.</div>

<p><i>All candidates</i> for the degree of Bachelor of Arts are
required to pass an examination in Holy Scripture. The
subjects of the examination are (1) the Gospels of St.
Matthew and St. John, and (2) <i>either</i> the subject-matter
of the Acts of the Apostles <i>or</i> one of the two Books of
Kings. Those who may make objection on religious
grounds are allowed to substitute the <i>Phaedo</i> of Plato. In
either case, a ‘viva voce’ examination follows. This examination
in Holy Scripture may be taken before or with
the Intermediate Examination; it must be passed before
a candidate for the B.A. is admitted to the Final Examinations.</p>

<p>Those who enjoy Senior standing are exempted from
the Intermediate Examination—Pass or Honour—altogether,
including also the Examination in Holy Scripture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Final Honour Schools.’</div>

<p>The candidate who has successfully passed the Intermediate
Examination, Pass or Honour, is now prepared
to proceed to one of the Final Honour Schools leading to
the Bachelor’s degree. Of these there are nine:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Literae Humaniores.</li>
<li>2. Modern History.<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p></li>
<li>3. Mathematics.</li>
<li>4. Natural Science.</li>
<li>5. Jurisprudence.</li>
<li>6. Theology.</li>
<li>7. Oriental Languages.</li>
<li>8. English Language and Literature.</li>
<li>9. Modern Languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>The names themselves will convey some general idea of
the subjects to be pursued for each of these ‘Schools’.
A few words about the requirements and work to be
done for the Final Examination in each of these nine
Schools may not be amiss here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Literae Humaniores.</div>

<p>‘The Final Classical School or the School of Literae
Humaniores is the oldest, and is admitted on all hands to
be the premier School in dignity and importance....
The course of combined studies for this School is peculiar
to ... Oxford. It is believed to confer a fine mental discipline
and to favour a catholic and genuine culture.’ The
general programme of studies includes the classical languages
and literature, Greek and Roman History, and
Philosophy. While textual criticism receives due attention,
it is literary study and treatment that is emphasized.
The study of the classical historians, in the original,
forms the basis of the work in history. In Philosophy,
which includes Moral and Political Philosophy and
Logic, the work is based on Plato and Aristotle, but
includes also the general history of Philosophy. The
‘Greats’ man is generally familiar with the works of
Maine, Mill, Green, Bryce, and other authorities. He is
also expected to be acquainted with the outlines of the
Theory of Knowledge from Descartes to Kant, more especially
with the philosophy of Locke, Berkeley, Hume
and Kant, and the study of Psychology receives some
attention. The essay work for and with the College
Tutor is especially valuable and a most important part of
the classical training received. The subjects of study
range far beyond the limits of classical antiquity.
‘The dominant note of the examination is ... general
culture upon a firm classical basis.’ Quite a number
of University prizes and scholarships are offered in
Classics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern History.</div>

<p>This is the first in numbers and the second in importance,
of the Final Honour Schools. The reading to be done
is very considerable, and a knowledge of French or German
is now compulsory. The subjects of the examination
include the Political and Constitutional History of England,
some special period of European History, Political
Science, and Political Economy. Those who aim at a
‘First’ or ‘Second’ in the Class Lists must further select
one of a list of special subjects to be studied with reference
to the original authorities, e. g. the Crusades, the French
Revolution, &amp;c. Certain other subjects connected with
the history of Literature and Art are optional. Much
stress is laid on Geography—for which special instruction
is provided—and on the social and literary history of the
period of European History studied. The courses of inter-collegiate
lectures are particularly well organized and
complete in Modern History, and an adequate teaching
force supplies efficient tuition. There is no special training
in historical method except as this is incidentally developed
by independent work under tutorial supervision.
The object of this School, as of most Honour Schools, is
not to produce specialists but to lay the foundations of
a liberal education. To stimulate and encourage historical
study the University offers three prizes—the Stanhope,
the Lothian, and the Arnold prizes. Special attention
should be called to the splendid library facilities at the
Bodleian Library, in addition to the various College
libraries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mathematics.</div>

<p>An inter-collegiate association provides a very complete
list of lectures in Mathematics. The subjects of the
examination are Pure and Mixed Mathematics. The
ordinary Professorial lectures ‘aim more at the introduction
of students to advanced study than at preparation
for the University examinations’. The Professors and
College Tutors and Lecturers are always prepared to give
personal advice and instruction. The University awards
each year a Senior and a Junior Mathematical Scholarship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural Science.</div>

<p>The Natural Science School really embraces seven distinct
co-ordinate subjects or courses of study, viz. (1)
Physics, (2) Chemistry, (3) Animal Physiology, (4) Zoology,
(5) Botany, (6) Geology, and (7) Astronomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>Special work may be done in any one of these subjects,
and combinations of several are possible. The course of
study will depend on the student’s choice of subject or
subjects for his final examinations. It is impossible to
go into all details here. Attention ought, however, to be
called to the excellent facilities provided, which are
generally underrated. Because of the heavy expenditure
which would be involved under the distinctly collegiate
system, the University undertakes most of the teaching
in Natural Science as well as making provision for the
practical work necessary and incidental thereto. Those
who intend to take up the study of medicine are recommended
to select either Physiology or Chemistry as a
preliminary.</p>

<p>Excellent facilities for laboratory work are provided
for at the University Museum. In addition, there are
the College laboratories at Christ Church, Magdalen,
Queen’s, New College, Balliol, and Trinity. Others are
in course of construction at Jesus College and at St. John’s
College (Rural Economy and Forest Botany).</p>

<p>In the Radcliffe Library are to be found more than 600
current scientific periodicals (English and foreign), and
some 60,000 volumes dealing with all branches of scientific
work. The University Museum contains excellent Zoological,
Mineralogical, Geological, Palaeontological, and
Petrological Collections. Here are to be found also the
Hope Collection of Anthropoid Animals, the second in
importance in the British Empire; the Hope Library,
containing perhaps the most complete collection in the
world on the Arthropoda; the Pitt-Rivers Museum, containing
a very comprehensive Ethnological collection;
and also the collections in Physical Anthropology, Human
Anatomy, and Pathology. The facilities both as regards
Working Staff and practical laboratory work deserve
special attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jurisprudence.</div>

<p>The curriculum provides for a systematic study of the
principles and history of Law. There is no opportunity
for practical work at Oxford—‘the case-system’ method
is not used. On the other hand, the reading to be done
under the direction of the Tutor will afford a very solid
foundation of the general principles of Law before entering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
on the practical and special study in chambers or in
court. This School is often taken after Honours have
been obtained in some other Final School. The subjects
of the Final Examinations are—(1) Jurisprudence, (2)
Roman Law, (3) English Law (including the Law of Contract,
of Succession, Real Property, and Constitutional
Law), (4) History of English Law, and (5) International
Law. The courses of lectures are given and arranged to
meet these requirements.</p>

<p>Every one who wishes to become a Barrister or Solicitor—the
two departments into which the practice of Law is
divided in England—must have kept nine Terms at the
Inns of Court, or have served five years as an articled
clerk in some solicitor’s office, and must pass certain
examinations. These are not under the control of the
University, though certain exemptions and concessions
are granted to those students who have passed examinations
at the University.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theology.</div>

<p>The subjects of the Final Examination in Theology are—(1)
specified portions of the Holy Scriptures based on a
study of the original texts, including (<i>a</i>) the history,
religion, and literature of Israel, and (<i>b</i>) the history, theology,
and literature of the New Testament; and (2) the
history and doctrine of the Christian Church till 461 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>;
this is based mainly on the study of Eusebius and certain
Patristic texts. In addition there are certain optional
subjects—Hebrew, Evidences of Religion, Liturgies,
Archaeology and Textual Criticism of the Old and New
Testaments, and certain special subjects. The main subjects
of study for this examination are historical. ‘In
addition to this training in historical method, the School
also affords scope for education in scholarship, in so far
as some texts must be read in the original languages.’
The candidate has a choice of texts in Greek, Latin, and
Hebrew. There is a good course of inter-collegiate lectures,
and the Professorial lectures offer a very wide range
of subjects. The library facilities are excellent. There
are a number of other institutions not directly connected
with the University which offer additional opportunities
for study and instruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oriental Languages.</div>

<p>The courses given in this School are intended ‘for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
most part for the practical acquisition of the language
studied’, and are of special value to candidates reading
for the Indian Civil Service. ‘The general subjects are
Sanskrit, Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian, and History as
connected with the literature of those languages.’ There
is a well-equipped library and museum in the Indian
Institute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English Language and Literature.</div>

<p>Though but recently established, the opportunities for
special study and for advanced instruction are well
organized, and offer the choice of a wide range of subjects.
The curriculum provides both for the philological
and for the literary study of the English Language.
Candidates are examined in (1) portions of certain prescribed
English authors, to be studied with reference to
the forms of the language; as examples of literature;
and in their relation to the history and thought of the
period to which they belong; (2) in the history of the
English Language and Literature, demanding a thorough
study of philology as well as of the history of literary
criticism. In addition, the candidate who aims at a first
or second class in the Final Examination must offer one
of a list of nine or ten special subjects in philology and
English literature. The examination requirements demand
very wide reading, as well as a thorough study of
some special period of English literature, or of some
special subject in philology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern Languages.</div>

<p>Complete courses of instruction are given in French,
German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and the Scandinavian
languages; instructions will also be provided for in other
European languages, if called for. All the Lecturers and
Professors are prepared to give special instruction. A recognized
authority is appointed from time to time to deliver
a public lecture on some subject of modern language or
comparative literature. Candidates reading for this
‘School’ are not required to offer more than one language.
They will be examined in ‘the language as spoken and
written at the present day’, in certain prescribed texts, in
the history, philology, and the literature of the language
offered. ‘This will include the history of criticism and
style in prose and verse, and the history, especially the
social history, of the corresponding country or countries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of Europe.’ In addition the candidate has the choice of
certain optional subjects as prescribed in the Examination
Statutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final Pass Schools.</div>

<p>For the sake of completeness, brief reference may be
made to the Final Examinations in the Pass Schools. The
subjects of the examination are divided into a number of
groups, each containing a certain number of subjects,
e. g. one group contains Classical subjects, another
Modern subjects, another Mathematics, &amp;c. Candidates
must satisfy the examiners in three subjects; as a rule
not more than two subjects may be taken from any one
Group. The examination in these subjects may be taken
separately, i. e. it is not necessary to take all of them in
the same Term, and no limitations (except by his College)
are placed on the number of the Pass-man’s efforts to
pass his ‘Groups’. In the course of time the University
examiners are said to be able to recognize familiar faces
in the Pass Schools with comparative ease—some cynics
say, with ill-concealed pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Graduate study.</div>

<p>The residential feature of the Oxford system, on the
one hand, and the stress laid on culture for its own sake,
on a liberal education, on the other, has not been very
favourable to the growth of special or graduate work.
The Oxford life makes heavy demands on the student’s
time. An ideal of culture and scholarship (in the English
sense of the word) will not have much in common with
the demands of technical and professional training, with
‘specialization’ and the scientific spirit. Conservative as
Oxford is, it has not shut its doors to the spirit of the
times. Despite Ruskin, ‘science’ has made decided inroads
and is to-day firmly entrenched in Oxford soil.
The new University Professorships and Lectureships
were another sign of the times. The extension and
perfecting of the examination system to meet the new
conditions, and the absence of any demand for ‘research’
work, discouraged the growth and development of the
Professorial system, and most of the Professorships
suffered by atrophy of functions and became part of the
larger inter-collegiate system. This must not be interpreted
to mean that all work became undergraduate in
character. No greater mistake could be made. As has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
been said, there is no hard and fast line at Oxford where
undergraduate work ends and graduate work begins. But
it is true that, apart from the work in Natural Science
and Medicine, Oxford makes little pretence of teaching
method <i>as method</i>. By an extension of the tutorial system,
it substitutes the direct personal contact between
the Professor and the student. There are advanced
lectures, to be sure, but they are purely formal. Wherever
there has been a demand for it, Professors have
always been ready to organize small classes for special
study—on the model of seminars, or even to accommodate
their lectures to the needs of advanced students. There
exists to-day a very substantial framework on which is
being organized an efficient Graduate School. New departments
are not created at Oxford ‘by act of legislature’,
nor are they grafted on to the system. They must be a
growth—a natural growth from within.</p>

<p>With the institution of the new ‘Research degrees’ in
Letters and Science<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, a good beginning has been made
in the way of a school of purely post-graduate study.
Recently, also, certain endowments for research have
been established or reconstituted. The institution of
‘Research’ Fellowships, as apart from the ordinary teaching
Fellowships held by College Tutors and Lecturers, is
but another indication of this new spirit and of the new
demands. Moreover, many College Tutors are working
in special fields or engaged in research, and are always
ready to advise the student or to give special individual
instruction.</p>

<p>The most valuable feature in the new system is that
‘the student enjoys the advantage of being brought into
close contact with those who have a first-hand acquaintance
with the department of knowledge to which he is
devoting himself, and are ready to give him the benefit of
their experience in researches similar to his own. Professors
and Readers in the University have gained a new
responsibility by being brought into relations with the most
earnest students in their respective branches of learning.’<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>But perhaps most important of all for the trained
research student is the inexhaustible material to be found
in that treasure-house, the Bodleian Library, in the Radcliffe
and the various special and College libraries, and in
the University Museums.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Research degrees.’</div>

<p>These new degrees, Bachelor of Letters and Bachelor
in Science, are open to all Oxford graduates (i. e. those
holding an Oxford B.A.), and also to other students who
are twenty-one years of age and who ‘can give satisfactory
evidence of having received a good general education’.
Rhodes Scholars who have taken their Bachelor’s degree
at some Colonial or American University will generally
be able to avail themselves of this latter regulation. All
candidates for these degrees in Letters or Science—and
this applies also to those reading for the degree of Bachelor
of Civil Law (see <a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a>)—should be sure to provide themselves
with the necessary credentials. They must be
prepared to present:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. A certificate of age.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. A certificate of degree or degrees already taken.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. A detailed statement of work done, or published
as a result of their special studies.</p>

</div>

<p>These credentials should be supplemented by:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">4. Letters of recommendation from former instructors
and Professors.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. A Catalogue or Register of the candidate’s University
or College.</p>

<p class="hanging">6. Candidates must present some definite subject of
study or research.</p>

</div>

<p>Once admitted to be a candidate for the degree, the
candidate’s work will be under the direction of a Committee
of two, one of whom is usually a Professor,
appointed by the Board of the Faculty to which his subject
belongs. In addition to the residence requirement
of eight University Terms (i. e. two years), he must first
have ‘satisfied the Board of Faculty, by examination
only, or by submitting a dissertation, which, if approved,
is necessarily followed by a viva voce examination. The
Board may further require the candidate to publish his
dissertation or some part of it.’ Any one who has taken
an Oxford B.A. has satisfied the necessary requirements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
as to residence for the Research degree, and, without necessarily
residing in the University, he can pursue his special
studies <i>in absentia</i> under the direction of the Committee
and proceed to his degree at his convenience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opportunities for research. Classical studies.</div>

<p>There are opportunities for research or advanced special
work in almost every field of knowledge, but some of them
deserve special mention. It goes without saying that the
student of the Classics, of Comparative Philology, and of
Ancient History will find at Oxford not merely the
technical facilities in the way of instruction, libraries, and
museums, but an atmosphere particularly favourable to
the prosecution of his studies. ‘Every College has one
or more classical lecturers on its staff who have usually
made a special study of some branch of classical learning.’
A glance at the list of Professors and Lecturers for the
Honour School of Literae Humaniores<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> will be sufficient
indication and guarantee of the adequacy and efficiency of
the instruction provided. Most of the Honour lectures
are of an advanced character.</p>

<p>The Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum (Arthur J.
Evans, D.Litt.) lectures (generally in Michaelmas Term)
on Minoan and Primitive Aegean Culture, or on other
prehistoric subjects. There are also opportunities for
special work in Archaeology and Geography. Courses
are given by specialists in Egyptology, Palaeography, and
Numismatics. Dr. Grenfell and Dr. Hunt are continuing
their work on the Oxyrhynchus Papyri.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Archaeology.</div>

<p>There is also a special endowment for research—the
Craven Fellowship, with an income of £200 per annum
for two years; eight months in each year must be spent
abroad. The British School of Archaeology in Athens
offers (usually every other year) a studentship of £50 to
some member of the University. The library facilities
are unexcelled: the Bodleian Library with more than
600,000 bound volumes of printed works, and some 30,000
bound volumes of manuscripts; the Radcliffe Camera, in
which are kept practically all English books published
since 1851, and where most of the leading periodicals may
be consulted; the Ashmolean Library, containing most of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the works on general archaeology; and the various College
libraries; the library of Oriel College containing a special
collection of books on Comparative Philology, and
Worcester College Library a valuable collection of books
on Classical Archaeology. The collections in the Ashmolean
Museum present some exceptional opportunities for
study in the following departments:—Prehistoric and
Early Dynastic Egypt; Primitive Anatolia (Hittite
Seals, &amp;c.); Primitive Greece and the Aegean; Greek
Vases; Greek and Graeco-Roman Bronzes; Greek Sculpture—collection
of casts; Greek and Roman Inscriptions.
There is a collection of coins in the Bodleian.</p>

<p>The Pitt-Rivers Museum contains a unique ethnological
collection, so arranged and classified as ‘to illustrate so
far as possible, by means of synoptic groups of specimens,
the actual or hypothetical origin and gradual development
of the various arts and appliances of mankind, as well as
their geographical distributions’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern History.</div>

<p>The opportunities for advanced and special instruction
in Modern History are excellent. There is a good system
of inter-collegiate lectures which will be useful even to
advanced students. The Regius Professor holds a small
class ‘specially designed for students working for the
B.Litt. degree’. There are courses in Palaeography and
Diplomatic by specialists, and facilities for doing special
or research work in Colonial History.</p>

<p>A series of six lectures is delivered by the Ford Lecturer,
elected annually, upon some particular period or
question connected with British History.</p>

<p>Special work is also offered in Geography.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Library facilities.</div>

<p>‘The <i>Bodleian Library</i> and the <i>Taylorian Library</i> of
foreign books are open to all matriculated members of the
University upon compliance with certain conditions as to
introduction. Each College also possesses a library, and
books and MSS. in the library of one College can usually
be consulted by members of other Colleges by arrangement
with the Librarian. The Bodleian Library, and
some of the College libraries, contain an immense quantity
of MSS. and materials for mediaeval history which
have been imperfectly explored. The Bodleian is also
extremely rich in collections of MSS. illustrating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
history of England during the sixteenth, the seventeenth,
and the early part of the eighteenth century, and many
Colleges possess important MSS. of the same period which
have been but little utilized by historians. The Carter
MSS. in the Bodleian are one of the chief sources for the
study of Irish History.’ Mention should also be made of
the library of the Oxford Architectural and Historical
Society, and of the special collections in the Ashmolean
Museum on Prehistoric Britain (Stone and Bronze and
Early Iron Age), Anglo-Saxon Britain, and of the Renaissance
Bronzes and Majolica, and of the library of the
Indian Institute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theology.</div>

<p>Many of the Honour lectures in <i>Theology</i> are adapted
to the needs of advanced students. Seminar classes are
also held in several subjects. A special University
Lectureship in Assyriology has been established; lectures
are given on the bearing of Assyriology upon the Old
Testament. The instructional staff is excellent. Two
theological colleges, Mansfield College (Congregational)
and Manchester College (undenominational), are both
well equipped with an efficient staff of lecturers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oriental studies.</div>

<p>Most of the courses in the School of Oriental Languages
are for the practical acquisition of the languages
offered. There are also some advanced lectures, and all
members of the teaching staff are prepared to give instruction
and advice to students taking up any special line of
Oriental studies. There is a very complete collection of
works on Egyptology in the Bodleian Library and in the
libraries of the Ashmolean Museum, of Queen’s College,
and of the Indian Institute. ‘The Indian Institute
Library contains about 23,000 volumes intended to represent
very fully the languages, the literature, the religions,
the institutions, the geography, the history, the
ethnology, the archaeology, and the administration of
ancient, mediaeval, and modern India.’ Very considerable
opportunities and facilities are here afforded for the study
of Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu, Persian, Arabic, Turkish,
Chinese, and Burmese. The library contains a collection
of 162 Sanskrit and Prākṛit MSS., and 64 Persian MSS.,
as well as a large number of maps of official publications
of the Indian Provincial Government. All the leading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Oriental Journals in English, French, and German are
kept here. The Museum of the Indian Institute is a
great aid to the historical study of Indian subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English Literature.</div>

<p>Though but very recently established, the work in the
Schools of English Language and Literature and of
Modern Languages calls for special consideration. The
facilities for research in the Bodleian, and especially in
the Taylorian Library, are very considerable.</p>

<p>‘The Taylorian Library contains about 40,000 volumes,
representing the languages of Modern Europe, English
(Anglo-Saxon, Early English), French, German, Dutch,
Scandinavian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Modern
Greek, Polish, Bohemian (Czech), Russian, Serbo-Croatian,
and Bulgarian. The chief subjects are the philology
and literature (mainly poetry and drama) of these languages,
and historical memoirs and biographies written
in them. The Library is specially strong in the literature
of Dante, Molière, Goethe and Schiller, Cervantes,
Lope de Vega, Calderon, Camoëns, and Old Norse Sagas.
The Finch Collection forms a special library of works on
the Fine Arts, written in French, German, Italian, and
other European languages.</p>

<p>A special <i>Seminar-Library</i> contains the leading literary
and philological periodicals on modern European Languages,
the books prescribed for the Honour School of
Modern Languages, and a selection of dictionaries, grammars,
and works of reference connected with the study of
modern languages.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural Science.</div>

<p>There are also abundant opportunities for research and
for special work in Natural Science. The laboratories in
the University Museum, at Christ Church, Magdalen,
Balliol, and Trinity are well equipped. At the Oxford
Museum are laboratories equipped for special study leading
to research work in Physics, Electricity, Chemistry,
Comparative Anatomy, Mineralogy, Geology, Physiology,
Human Anatomy, Pathology and Bacteriology, each
under the direct charge of the Professor of the subject.
The teaching in Pathology, Comparative Anatomy,
and Physiology is adapted to the needs of those preparing
for Medicine. Special rooms have been set
apart for original research work in experimental Pathology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and Bacteriology, in Pathological Chemistry and
Histology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diplomas.</div>

<p>Special work may also be done along certain lines for
which diplomas are granted by the University. These
have been only recently introduced. ‘At present they
are given for a course of work extending over a year or
more in such subjects as Education, Geography, Economics,
Engineering and Mining, Anthropology, and
Forestry, the object being to supplement the ordinary
curriculum for the B.A. degree by providing for more
special lines of study.’ There are seminar-classes in
Geography and Economics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">B.C.L.</div>

<p>The advanced work in Law is of a very special character.
Most of the lectures in Law are intended for those
reading for the Jurisprudence School, so that the candidate
for the B.C.L. is thrown largely upon his own
resources. Prof. Vinogradoff lectures on the History
of Law and Comparative Jurisprudence, and also holds
a seminar-class along these lines. But the bulk of the
work for the degree must be done in private under the
direction and supervision of the College Tutor. The
examination for the B.C.L. is one of the most difficult
University examinations. It covers a very wide field
and the standard required is very high. Candidates
must possess a fair knowledge of Latin, as certain special
subjects in Roman Law are studied in the original. The
subjects studied are concerned in the main with the
theoretical side of legal study, with the general principles
and the history of Law.</p>

<p>Students from the Colonies who are intending to enter
at one of the Inns of Court will find no difficulty in
keeping their Terms during their residence at Oxford.
The residence requirements at the Inns of Court merely
consist in eating three dinners during each Term.</p>

<p>The library of All Souls—the Codrington Library—contains
a very complete collection of works on Law and
the history of Law—Roman, English, and foreign. The
English Law Reports of all periods, as also the principal
American and Colonial Reports, are to be found here.</p>

<p>Several Scholarships are offered by the University for
proficiency in legal studies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>The degree of B.C.L.—like the Research degrees of
B.Litt. and B.Sc.—is open to all who have taken an
Oxford B.A., and to persons above twenty-one years of
age who have obtained a degree in Arts or in Philosophy
or in Science in some other University, and who have
satisfied the Board of the Faculty of Law that they will
be qualified to pursue an advanced course of legal study.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Honours can be obtained only by those candidates who
at the time of examination have not exceeded twelve
Terms (i. e. three years) from the date of their matriculation.
The minimum residence requirement is eight
Terms.</p>

<p>The examination for the B.C.L. includes the following
subjects:—</p>

<p>1. Jurisprudence (and Theory of Legislation).</p>

<p>2. Roman Law:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(1) The principles of Roman Private Law, as set forth
in the Institutes of Justinian (to be read in the
original).</p>

<p class="hanging">(2) One special subject.—<i>Either</i> Ownership and Possessions
(cf. <i>Digest</i> xli. and xxiii. 1) <i>or</i> Theory of
Contract generally (cf. <i>Digest</i> xlv. 1).</p>

</div>

<p>3. English Law:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(1) Real and Personal Property.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="smaller">EXPENSES</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The question of Expense, like many other Oxford
questions, is very difficult to discuss within the limits of
a general statement. And yet this has arisen with probably
greater frequency than any other single question
since it was announced that the Rhodes Scholarships
were to have an annual value of £300. Is Oxford expensive?
How far will £300 carry a man? Why and how
do the various Colleges vary in expensiveness? What
are the necessary expenditures?</p>

<p>In one of its memoranda (U.S.A.) the Rhodes Trust
makes the following statement:—</p>

<p>‘The sum of £300 is no more than is necessary to
cover the expenses of the year, including Vacations as
well as Term. A Scholar must not therefore count on
his Scholarship as leaving any margin—least of all in his
first year, in which, owing to unavoidable initial payments,
expenses are heaviest. Experience suggests that
a Scholar should start his Oxford career free from financial
embarrassment.’</p>

<p>Mr. Wells, in his chapter on expenses of Oxford Life,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
discusses and gives reasons for the various financial demands
which the average student has to meet. Stripped
of the discussion, his opinion is, ‘it may fairly be said
that a man who wishes to live like other people, but is
willing to be careful, may be at College for about £160<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
a year, out of which he can pay for his clothes, travelling,
&amp;c., and find himself in pocket-money.’ But this,
of course, implies that he has a home at which to spend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
his Vacations, while no allowance is made for travelling
in Vacation.</p>

<p>‘Oxford is emphatically a place for the well-to-do, or
those who by their brains have provided themselves with
scholarships and exhibitions.’</p>

<p>‘The whole tradition of the place is against economy....
The world in general expects Oxford to entertain
it, ... and I do not think we disappoint expectations
in this respect.’</p>

<p>‘At the same time ... the cost of an Oxford education
cannot be called high, judged by the standard of
what is usually paid for education in England.’</p>

<p>There is no need for attempting here an explanation of
the reasons for the facts which occasion these conclusions
as set forth by Mr. Wells; but, keeping these statements
in mind in connexion with the following sketch
of necessary expenditures, one may readily see the
reason for the statement in the Rhodes Trust’s Memorandum
as quoted above.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>£300 is a comfortable sum, but it does not leave
margins to be wasted in riotous living or hoarded as
a nucleus for a fortune. It will carry the careful man
through the year; but Rhodes evidently thought that in
most cases the Scholars would have some supplementary
means—an asset, under the circumstances, very
desirable.</p>

<p>The Rhodes Scholar who expects to live <i>the year round</i>
on £300 should realize at once that he is not to lay out
for himself an extravagant programme. He will have,
in fact, to figure closely in order to make this sum cover
his <i>necessary</i> expenses for the whole year.</p>

<p>There exists a considerable difference in the averages
of expense for different Colleges. This statement should
not, however, be misinterpreted. It is <i>possible</i>, mathematically,
to live at what would be styled ‘an expensive
College’ at a minimum not much greater than that
of a ‘cheap College’ (excepting special arrangements,
e. g. Keble and St. Edmund Hall). But when it comes
to practice, the atmosphere of the Colleges must be taken
into consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>In order to enjoy the advantages of College life, to get
and to give the best possible, the student should be ready
and able to move on a plane with the average men about
him. This does not mean that he shall go with the
most expensive ‘set’ in his College, but he should be
able to follow Rhodes’s famous injunction, ‘Do the comparative.’</p>

<p>Every Oxford Student has sooner or later to draw
on his bank account to meet the following demands:—</p>

<p>Necessary expenses <i>for every one</i> include—</p>

<p><b>1. University Expenses.</b></p>

<p>1. Matriculation (once only) £3 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>2. University Quarterly Dues, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (twelve shillings
and sixpence) per Term (four times per year).</p>

<p>3. Examination Fees (see <a href="#Page_103">Table, p. 103</a>).</p>

<p>4. University Degree Fees (see <a href="#Page_103">Table, p. 103</a>).</p>

<p><b>2. College Expenses.</b></p>

<p>1. Entrance, or Matriculation, Fee required in most
Colleges—average £5 (once only) (see <a href="#Page_105">Table, p. 105</a>).</p>

<p>2. Caution money. Caution money is a deposit of
a certain sum in advance, required in most Colleges, in
order to secure the College against loss through damage
to property or non-payment of College bills. With
regard to <i>Rhodes Scholars</i> each College has made its own
arrangements. As these arrangements stand at present,
fourteen Colleges require no deposit; four have required
£10; one has required £20; and one has required £40;
while two do not require caution money of any one.
(For the sake of foreign students, the sums ordinarily
required of Commoners have been included in the Table
at the end of this Chapter, col. 2.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>)</p>

<p>Caution money, when required, is, as a rule, paid back,
in whole or in part, when the student ‘goes down’
(finally); in some instances a part is retained and applied
to the expense of ‘keeping name on the College books’
and towards paying for M.A. degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p><b>3. Furnishing.</b> It is necessary for every student in
College to provide himself with table-linen and table-ware,
bed linen, &amp;c. For instance, one College suggests,
‘2 pair sheets, 3 pillow-cases, 3 table-cloths, 6 towels,
toilet-covers, glass-cloths, dusters, set of china (½ doz.);
6 each of small knives, large knives, teaspoons, dessert-spoons,
table-spoons, small forks, large forks, tumblers,
... cruet-stands, salt-cellars and spoons.’ Kettle, coffee
and teapots are also needed. These items may involve
from £7 up, according to the taste of the individual. Frequently
some of them may be purchased from the scout.</p>

<p>The incoming tenant often finds it necessary to purchase
or rent several additions to the furniture which he
finds in his rooms (see <i>Furniture</i>, <i>infra</i>), and often has
to see to numerous repairs—for the furniture is handed
on ‘from generation to generation’.</p>

<p><b>4. Tuition.</b> Under ordinary circumstances undergraduates
pay the regular tuition specified in the following
Table, averaging £8 per Term. Research students
are in some cases released from a part of this tuition, but
may have to pay for other tuition (special).</p>

<p><b>5. Room-rent.</b> Rhodes Scholars will spend their first
two years at least <i>in</i> College. (For rental rates, see
<a href="#Page_105">Table, p. 105</a>.) On an average, rooms in College cost less
rental than ‘licensed lodgings’. (See <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>.)</p>

<p><b>6. Furniture—Rental or Purchase.</b> It is the custom
in Oxford for the out-going tenant to leave most of his
furniture for <i>sale</i> to the incoming tenant. The College
has an assessor who ‘values’ the furniture each time the
room changes occupants. Some Colleges act merely as
‘sales agents’, the purchase money passing from new to
old occupant through the College offices. In many cases
the College <i>owns</i> the furniture and rents it to the student.
Where rental is allowed the cost comes to about fifteen per
cent. of the valuation of the furniture, per year; that is,
about five per cent. is charged for use of the furniture,
and ‘depreciation’ is charged at the rate of from five per
cent. to ten per cent. per year.</p>

<p><b>7. Battels.</b> The term ‘battels’ is used in two senses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
In its larger sense it is applied to the Terminal bill which
is sent three times per year by the College to each of its
students. In this sense it embraces all items of current
account between College and student (including University
Quarterly dues); College dues; tuition; College
(amalgamated) clubs<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; room-rent; furniture-rent; ‘establishment
charges’ (i. e. cost of maintaining College plant,
&amp;c.); meals; groceries; coal; lights; laundry; messenger
and gate-bills; fines; and all extra charges (percentages,
breakage bills, special fees, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>In its restricted sense ‘battels’ means a weekly statement
which covers dinners in hall—all meals; groceries
and supplies for breakfasts, luncheons, teas and coffee
from kitchen, buttery, and common-room; coal and
faggots; messenger and gate fees (i. e. items of consumption
and of special service).</p>

<p>These statements are sent out each week—dinners in
hall average 12<i>s.</i>-14<i>s.</i> per week. In Winter Terms coal
and faggots average about 4<i>s.</i> per week (less in Summer
Term). The other items are entirely at disposal of the
individual.</p>

<p>It is <i>possible</i> to keep these weekly bills as low as £1 5<i>s.</i>,
but this is far below the average. From £12 to £20<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> per
Term is a fair estimate, with moderate living, for these
items.</p>

<p><b>8. Additional Charges.</b> There are a certain number
(as reference to <i>Handbook</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chap. iii</a>, will show) of not inconsiderable
charges, which might be classed collectively
as ‘fixed charges’ were it not that they vary in different
Terms, or as ‘establishment charges’ were it not that
that term differs in its comprehensiveness in different
Colleges. In this class we may collect those charges
which are made by each College under some or all of the
following designations.</p>

<p><i>Establishment charges</i>:—Strictly speaking, for maintenance
of College buildings and current expense of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
College plant; library fund; building fund; College dues;
porters; bed-making; shoe-cleaning; percentage charged
on kitchen and grocery bills, rates, taxes<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, increased in
direct proportion to totals of other parts of battels which
cover optional items.</p>

<p><b>9. Gratuity to College servants.</b> The Colleges recognize
a ‘tip’ to the scout, and scout’s boy; and small tips
to porters, messengers, boot-cleaners, &amp;c., are customary.
In-College students may reckon about £2-£3 per term
for these gratuities.</p>

<p><b>10. Amalgamated Clubs.</b> The membership in College
clubs is one of the ‘not compulsory but obligatory’ items
in College expenses. Students are not required to join,
but every man who is active in the College life becomes
a member of the Amalgamated Club. Initiation fee
averages £2 (paid, of course, <i>once</i> only); Terminal dues
average £2, three times per year (generally included in
Terminal battels).</p>

<p>These are what may fairly be considered the <i>necessary</i>
items of current expense, exclusive of University charges,
degree fees, the sum which is laid down as caution money,
and investment in furniture, furnishings and repairs.</p>

<p>The total of Terminal battels will amount, for a man
who lives comfortably without extravagance, to between
£40 and £55 per term (three times per year) according to
his College. This is exclusive of books, clothing, and any
‘not-College’ expenses.</p>

<p><b>11. Degree Fees.</b> Each College charges a fee, varying
from £1 1<i>s.</i> to £7, when a student takes a B.A. degree;
from £1 1<i>s.</i> to £8 4<i>s.</i> when he takes an M.A., &amp;c. (see
<a href="#Page_105">Table, p. 105</a>). This is exclusive of and in addition to
the degree fee charged by the University.</p>

<p>In addition to these <i>necessary</i> College expenses it may
be as well to have in mind other probable expenses.</p>

<p><b>Athletics.</b> Athletic life, almost universal in Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
involves the purchase of one’s own costumes and outfit.
Entrance into various contests costs small sums ranging
from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in College tennis tournaments, to £3 10<i>s.</i>
before one may enter inter-College boat races.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> To the
man who is successful in athletics expenditure for ribbons
and blazers involves some outlay, often considerable.
Needless to say, such expenses should be very welcome.</p>

<p><b>Clubs (other than the Amalgamated Clubs).</b> Membership
to the Union costs £1 1<i>s.</i> entrance fee, and £1 5<i>s.</i>
per Term; or life membership may be commuted at
£10 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The in-College clubs are inexpensive, with a few exceptions.
Several University clubs cost at the rate of about
£1 1<i>s.</i> per Term; while a few of the more exclusive clubs
are very expensive.</p>

<p><b>Subscriptions.</b> Certain charitable subscriptions, to
which most men give, may average about £1 10<i>s.</i> per
year.</p>

<p><b>Occasional Expenses.</b> Exceptional expenses, which
a man may expect to meet at least once during his three
years, are subscriptions for sending a College crew to
some regatta, which involves from £1 up; and for a
College ball, which will also average about £1.</p>

<p>Rental of a punt or canoe during Summer Term is not
a necessity, but it is a very possible extra, involving
another pound or two.</p>

<p>To discuss riding and driving, &amp;c., of course takes us
into the realm of luxuries.</p>

<p>It is useless to deal with optional details; but when
all is said and done, the man who expects to take Oxford
as Oxford is, and who, while not extravagant, is at the
same time not inclined to stint himself, must expect to
put between £175 and £200 as a <i>minimum</i> into his six
months at Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>The intricacy and the elastic possibilities of the battel-sheet,
together with the diversity of plans existing in
different Colleges, make it impossible to arrive at accurate
comparative figures, but the following is a fair sample of
one Term’s battels.</p>

<span class="smaller">OPPORTUNITIES<br>
THE VALUE OF A RHODES SCHOLARSHIP—QUALIFICATIONS—CHOICE
OF A COLLEGE—CHOICE OF WORK—ADVANTAGES</span></h3>

</div>

<p>There are two questions which are of vital importance
to every person who is considering a Rhodes Scholarship,
whether Candidate, member of a Committee of Selection,
or a chosen Scholar. What advantages does a Rhodes
Scholarship offer? What opportunities does Oxford offer
to a man who has won the Scholarship?</p>

<p>The ultimate answer to both depends upon the type of
man who is chosen; while two very important factors are
the spirit in which the Scholar accepts his appointment
and the course which he chooses to follow at Oxford.</p>

<p>There can be found no better statement of the qualities
which are desired in the typical Scholar than that which
Rhodes himself suggested (see <a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>). In this outline,
Rhodes, consciously or unconsciously, epitomized the
qualifications of the best product (in theory at least) of
the Oxford life and system. Naturally, the better the
adaptive possibilities of the material, the better the
chance of turning out a finished product of the desired
quality.</p>

<p>A few words may serve to emphasize the comprehensiveness
of these qualifications. Rhodes’s first requirement
was that regard should be paid to ‘literary and
scholastic attainments’. However, to this qualification
he gives, in his scheme of units, but three points in ten.
He desired neither ‘bookworms’ nor ‘grinds’; but men
with the broad interests of the student, which lie not
alone in intense study of books, but in a wide humanity
and true culture. Rhodes preferred men who, with fixed
habits of work and high scholastic ambitions, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
time are alive to the importance of guarding ‘lest our
culture separate us from humanity’; he believed that
education consists in giving as well as getting, and that
the danger of too high scholastic aims lies in drawing the
scholar away from active participation in the political
and social life of his fellow students. For this reason,
while he insists upon a high standard of scholarship, he
gives seven points in ten to qualifications other than
scholastic.</p>

<p>‘Fondness for, and success in, manly outdoor sports’
ought not to allow of much misinterpretation. Yet
Rhodes Scholars were once advertised as ‘all athletes’,
and there has been disappointment in some quarters
because they are not ‘all athletes’. There are degrees of
athleticism. One may be athletic without being an athlete.
And it has happened that one may be a Rhodes
Scholar without being particularly athletic. However,
‘fondness for manly outdoor sports’ is above all a characteristic
of Oxford men. ‘Exercise’ is a part of Oxford
life. The athlete has great advantages in the Oxford
system. The man who comes to Oxford without athletic
propensities and without a hearty interest in sports is apt
not only to have a dull time of it, but to find himself
in an ‘unhealthy, enervating atmosphere’. It is not
necessary that one be a ‘record’ man or a ‘star’, but
the athletic qualification should be given its proper significance.</p>

<p>The third qualification resolves itself into honest manhood
and good-fellowship, and is closely linked with the
fourth, which insists upon moral force of character and
the qualities of leadership. These requirements do not
mean that one shall play the ‘lion in society’ any more
than that he shall attempt to dominate in the activities
of his College. They mean that he shall possess the moral
and social qualifications, the personality that will make
him fit into the Oxford system; it means that he shall be
a straightforward, enthusiastic, ‘social animal’; that he
shall enjoy, and find interests in, and improve by, comradeship
and mutual friendships. If an Oxford student neglect
the ‘social side’ he will have lost some of the best opportunities
which Oxford life affords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Rhodes on one occasion defined a University education
as the ‘education of rubbing shoulders with every kind of
individual and class on absolutely equal terms’; and it
was this education of which he wished the Rhodes Scholars
to partake.</p>

<p>Moral force of character is a qualification which cannot
be too much insisted upon. Cut off from home ties and
home influences for three years, with six months of each
spent in travel and among strangers, with the opportunity
and at the same time the necessity to decide nearly all
questions which arise without check and with little
counsel, moral force and will power are not only invaluable,
but indispensable assets. The question of age
has here an important bearing. No definite age can be
set as absolutely the best, but the general experience so
far would seem to point to a desirability that the men be
mature. By that we mean that a man should have arrived
at a point where his experience, his knowledge of himself
and of men, and his knowledge both of books and of business,
render him capable of forming quick, accurate, and
independent judgements, of choosing his work, of initiating
and pursuing his own plans, of working without
a task-master and independent of mere textbooks; of
carrying his plans to fulfilment, and of accomplishing his
work in spite of a multitude of distractions and side interests
which will make constant bids for his attention.</p>

<p>There is, however, danger in choosing too mature a
man. He may be so advanced in his studies or so old
in his habits as to find Oxford unprofitable or uncongenial.
He may be so deeply interested in his definite
line of work, or ‘take himself so seriously’, as not to
‘mix’ well. He may be so set in his ways as to be
unadaptable to Oxford ways. There is such a thing as
too much self-reliance. The Rhodes Scholar should have
‘independence of character’ and should have ‘principles’,
but he should not assert an aggressive individuality. He
should be able and ready to get into sympathy with English
life and English ideals; he should remember ‘when
in Rome to do as the Romans’, in so far as the customs
of the Romans do not conflict with his principles and
ideals; he should ‘catch on’, be able if necessary to rearrange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
his wardrobe and his vocabulary, and to readjust
his political and social vision. All this a man may do
without losing one particle of his own local or national
patriotism.</p>

<p>Rhodes’s favourite maxim was ‘do the comparative’.
That would perhaps be his first injunction to Rhodes
Scholars. He asked for <i>men</i>—the greater their ability
the better; he did not demand the superlative; but he
did object to less than the ‘comparative’ <i>in any respect</i>.</p>

<h4>Choice of a College.</h4>

<p>It must be plainly evident from what has preceded on
the subject of Oxford, that the choice of a College is
a matter of very considerable importance. Although in
some ways not of so much consequence to students from
abroad as to Englishmen, yet in others it is even more
desirable that the foreign student be satisfied with his
College environment. An English student, no matter
what his College, will probably have a number of friends
and old ‘school-fellows’ in other Colleges. A student
from abroad, an American for instance, will be more
limited to chance acquaintances among the students outside
his own College. Moreover, to the Rhodes Scholar
Oxford becomes in a sense ‘home’ during his three years.
And when all points are considered, one’s impressions of
Oxford and of Oxford men—and to that extent of England
and Englishmen—are bound to be influenced predominantly
by the character of his immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>Englishmen are influenced in their choice of a College
by several motives: family associations, ‘school’ traditions,
scholastic reputation, social character, athletic
fame. Some men go where their fathers went; others
where their school-fellows go; others to Colleges which
are ‘high’ on the river; others to ‘football’ Colleges;
others where ‘Honour men’ are sought; others where
they happen to obtain or expect to obtain ‘scholarships’
or ‘exhibitions’; and still others—where they can.</p>

<p>The Rhodes Scholars will not ordinarily be so directly
affected by these considerations, but will be no less
inclined to look to the traditions and history of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
College and the character and personnel of its past and
present student body and the ideals which the College
represents. The names on the tutorial list will be of
decided interest, especially to the man who contemplates
advanced work; but this consideration should weigh even
more with the student who is going to do undergraduate
work for the reason that in the former case the man who
is doing research work will very possibly work under
a ‘Tutor’ outside his College, while nearly always those
doing undergraduate work are under Tutors of the College
to which they belong.</p>

<p>Under the present arrangement a Rhodes Scholar,
when appointed, is to send to Mr. Wylie, along with
his credentials (see <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>), a list containing the names of
several (five or six) Colleges in the order of his choice.
One has no assurance that he will be admitted to the
College of his first choice, as the methods of selection
and the limits of accommodation of individual Colleges, as
well as the provision of the Rhodes Trust that the
scholars shall be distributed among the Colleges, prevent
the entrance of large numbers at any one time into any
one College.</p>

<p>Thus it is important that one be careful not only in
making his first, but in making his second, his third,
and even his fourth choice. One should carefully consult
what sources of information he can, and be as familiar as
possible with the characters of the Colleges which he
names in his list.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Expense, for instance, may be considered by some.
There is some difference between the cost of living at
various Colleges. Yet one should not let a difference of
a few pounds outweigh other considerations which, were
that eliminated, would attract him to other Colleges.
The advantages which one thinks he may obtain from congenial
surroundings—the influence of certain traditions,
the presence of certain Tutors—the atmosphere which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
best adapted to one’s disposition and to his work; these
should be the considerations which determine a choice.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to future applicants, in this connexion,
to know that a thick volume of eulogistic letters
of recommendation, &amp;c., is not so highly prized in Oxford
as it may seem to be in certain other places. The facts—all
of them—are wanted, in a plain, matter-of-fact,
concise form. But pages of glowing praise are likely to
cause first amazement, then amusement, then suspicion,
and sometimes rejection in certain Senior Common-rooms
in Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Standing.</div>

<p>It has been often asked: how may one know whether
he is going to obtain ‘Senior or Junior standing or
neither’? A positive answer is difficult. However, any
one may at once learn from his own University whether
it is affiliated with Oxford or not, and whether his local
standing will entitle him to Oxford Senior standing.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>If not, he may still entertain hopes for senior Standing
in case he has obtained ‘honours’ (e. g. <i>Phi Beta Kappa</i>,
or <i>summa cum laude</i>) with his degree. The student who
cannot qualify for Senior standing may reasonably expect
to obtain Junior standing if he has a degree and can show
a satisfactory record in a satisfactory course.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<h4>Choice of Work.</h4>

<p>To make the most of his opportunities it is essential
that the Rhodes Scholar shall as early as possible choose
the course of study which he wishes to pursue at Oxford.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Owing to the difficulty of adjusting himself to the Oxford
method and system, one is likely, unless he studies the
matter out carefully, to lose much valuable time. As
soon as appointed the Rhodes Scholar should inform
himself as quickly and as thoroughly as possible, from
what sources may be available, and further, if necessary,
by correspondence, as to the opportunities and facilities
and the requirements for work in the subject in which he
is interested. It should be borne in mind that Oxford
does not draw a sharp line between ‘undergraduate’ and
‘graduate’ study; that reading for the B.A. degree in an
Oxford Honour School is to a large extent ‘specializing’,
and that the work need by no means be a repetition of
what one has done elsewhere in getting his B.A.; that
the tutorial system calls for a large amount of private
reading with elastic limitations, with much work during
Vacations; and that this system will require in most
cases a radical readjustment of habits and methods of
work.</p>

<p>A brief restatement of courses and combinations of
courses which are most readily open to Rhodes Scholars
may simplify this problem to some extent. Every Rhodes
Scholar has before him the choice<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> (1) of reading for
a B.A. in one of the nine Honour Schools; (2) of doing
‘special study’ for which a Diploma is granted; (3) of
doing research work for the Bachelor’s degree in Letters
or Science; or (4) of taking the course for the degree of
Bachelor of Civil Law. In some cases two of these
courses may be combined.</p>

<p>The fact that more than half of the Rhodes Scholars
now in residence, after having taken their B.A.’s in
American or Colonial Universities, are reading in the
Honour Schools, is evidence sufficient to show that they
are able to find courses leading to the B.A. in Oxford
which are considerably more than mere repetitions or
reviews of their former courses. The Classical, the
History, and the Law courses have proved especially
available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Most Rhodes Scholars, in case they do not receive Senior
standing (which permits them to read directly for their
Final Schools), find it advisable to take <i>Pass</i> Moderations
or the Preliminary Examination in Jurisprudence (‘Law
Prelim.,’ see <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>) rather than Honour Moderations, so
as to begin reading for Final Schools as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Most Rhodes Scholars will require their full three years
for doing an Honour School, unless beginning with Senior
standing or giving up several Vacations to hard study.
Students with Senior standing, or, in some cases, with
Junior standing, will be able to finish their work for the
B.A. at the end of the second year, leaving the third free
for special study (e. g. for a Diploma, or for a B.Sc. or
B.Litt. or B.C.L.). However, where a man wishes to
take his Honour examinations at the end of his second
year, he must, unless he be already well up in his subject,
be ready at once for hard and consistent work.</p>

<p>It may be found very practicable and profitable to
combine studies leading to a Diploma with a course of
reading for the B.A.</p>

<p>For the advantageous pursuit of research work for
the degrees B.Sc. or B.Litt., it is necessary that the
student fix upon some clearly defined and limited subject
for original work, and it will be a great advantage for
him to have already become acquainted with research
methods in his home University. The research student
at Oxford is thrown largely upon his own resources as to
method. The guidance and advice of Professors and
Tutors who are specialists will be of great value; but
this is in most cases limited to a few hours per Term of
private audience. If the student is well up in his subject
he may generally complete the work for a B.Litt. or
a B.Sc. degree in two years. Or, if he has done special
work in preparing for an Honour School during his first
two years, he may be able to obtain a B.Litt. or B.Sc. at
the end of his third year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">B.C.L.</div>

<p>The work for the advanced degree of Bachelor of Civil
Law covers a much wider range of studies than is required
at most American Law Schools; but it is not so practical.
Special attention is paid to the study of Roman Law,
a fair knowledge of Latin being required. The course of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
study includes the general field of English Law, Jurisprudence,
and International Law. The work in English
Law will prove a valuable foundation for those intending
to practise in American Courts. Most of the work for
the degree must, however, be done in private. There
are lectures, to be sure, and there is the weekly conference
for an hour or two with the Tutor, during the eight weeks
of Term. It is very advisable, therefore, that Rhodes
Scholars who have had only a general course in Law
or who have had no legal training whatever before
coming to Oxford, should read for the Bachelor’s degree
in the Honour School of Jurisprudence, and not to
attempt to enter upon the more advanced work for the
B.C.L. immediately. Practically all the work done for
the B.A. degree in Jurisprudence will be of value in
reading for the B.C.L. degree, which may possibly be
taken during the third year by the more ambitious
students. Such a course of study, however, will leave
the Rhodes Scholar with little or no time for travel
during his Vacations. It will mean close, persistent, hard
work throughout the entire three years, during Term-time
and during most of the Vacations.</p>

<p>Attention ought to be called to the opportunities
offered in Science and Medicine at Oxford, which seem to
be generally underrated. The laboratory facilities are in
most cases adequate and the staff of instruction very large
and efficient.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The long residence requirement for the
degree in Medicine makes it impossible for the Rhodes
Scholar who intends to stay at Oxford for three years
only to take this degree.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to repeat here what has been said
about the value of an Oxford education from the broader
point of view of the Oxford life sketched in a previous
chapter. Add to the many opportunities for broad culture
and social training the opportunity of meeting Rhodes
Scholars from all parts of the British Empire, the United
States, and Germany. The friendships formed will prove
not the least of the many opportunities and the pleasant
experiences of the three years at Oxford. The student, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
whatever sphere his interests lie, will find golden opportunities,
not so much for getting the most out of life, but
for putting the most into it, and enriching it, with wise
experience, pleasant memories, and high ideals. ‘The
embryo doctor, lawyer, journalist, clergyman, politician,
who aims at the highest can by the help of this bequest
spend three additional years, unoppressed by anxious
care, in laying broadly and firmly the intellectual basis
on which his professional work is to be done.’ For the
benefit of those who are thinking of entering the public
service of their country, the words of Mr. Harris, United
States Commissioner of Education, may be quoted here:—‘We
must educate hundreds of our scholars and politicians
in studies of Jurisprudence and International
Law; we must have a corps of trained specialists who
know the minute details of each great nation’s past history
and present achievements—Great Britain, Germany,
France, Russia, Austria, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium,
and the Scandinavian countries. The Rhodes bequest is
the most timely of gifts for higher education, because it
gives opportunity to begin this education of that class of
our population which will furnish our consulates, our
home offices, and our embassies with attachés. Out of
the most successful of these will come by and by our
foreign ministers and our home experts in diplomacy.</p>

<p>‘England is the best place in which to begin this work.
The excellence of the University of Oxford is without
doubt the training of the ready gentleman who cannot be
pushed off his feet by an attack upon the weaknesses of
his personality. His training at Oxford gives him that
secure self-possession and self-respect which commands
the respect of his fellows. Our American students need
have no fear that they will lose their nationality at
Oxford, for they will find the English ideal of a gentleman
exactly fitted for Anglo-Saxons everywhere. The more
perfectly they accept its training in this regard the more
ready they will be for the great work of extending our
American influence in the councils of the world.’</p>

<p>Stubbs said, in his inaugural address as Professor of
History at Oxford, ‘We want to train not merely students
but citizens; and citizens of the great communities—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Church and the civilized world; to be fitted not for
criticism or for authority in matters of memory, but for
action.’ Oxford has long been the training-school for the
great men of England, but she has of late years made it
more and more her endeavour to conform to this ideal—that
is, to train men for action. Whatever the defects
of the system, it nevertheless remains true that the
Oxford student is brought under the influence of the
same scholastic training which the rulers of the British
Empire have enjoyed; and he not only sees and feels the
working of that machinery, but he is, as an undergraduate,
intimately associated with the men who will within the
next half-century lead in English life and thought.</p>

<p>Add to these opportunities and influences the advantages
of travel in England and on the Continent during
the half-year of Vacation, of becoming familiar with
modern European languages, of studying political thought,
the Press and public opinion, the institutions and customs
and characteristics of the different countries, of getting
a first-hand acquaintance with contemporary Europe (not
to mention the advantages for the study of history and
art), and of looking at American and Colonial affairs
through European spectacles. The Japanese are sending
students in great numbers from one country to another,
students who observe and compare and test—and they
are choosing and adopting the best which they find in
each. Why should not other nations learn more from
one another? Wider experience and wider knowledge
mean broader and saner judgements, a truer perspective,
a clearer vision, a juster and more sympathetic appreciation
of the achievements, the methods, the objects, and
the ideals of the contemporary nations, together with
a better understanding of one’s own country and a better
equipment for and a higher ideal of the duties and
possibilities of citizenship.</p>

first year he made 10 per cent., which he added to his
capital. In the second year he made 20 per cent. and
added the profits to his capital. In the third year he
again made 20 per cent., and laid out $60,000 on real
estate. How much capital would he have left in the
business at the beginning of the fourth year?</p>

<p>2. Find the difference between</p>

<p>9⅕ - 1⅔ × 3⅜ and 2¾ × 1⅙ - ⅘.</p>

decimals.</p>

<p>4. If, by selling an article for $2, a man gains ⅐ of the
cost price, at what price must he sell it so as to gain
8 per cent.?</p>

<p>5. The area of one side of a cubical cistern is 14·0625

<h4>III. LATIN PROSE COMPOSITION.</h4>

<p>Translate into Latin:—</p>

<p>When the bridge was nearly all cut away, Horatius
made his two companions leave him, and pass over into
the city. Then he stood alone on the bridge, and defied
all the army of the Etruscans: and they showered their
javelins upon him, and he caught them on his shield and
stood yet unhurt. But just as they were rushing at
him, to drive him from his post by main force, the last
beams of the bridge gave way, and it all fell with a
mighty crash into the river. While the Etruscans
wondered, and stopped in their course, Horatius turned
and prayed to the god of the river: ‘O father Tiber,
I pray thee to receive these arms and me who bear them,
and to let thy waters befriend and save me.’ Then he
leaped into the river, and though the darts fell all around
him, yet they did not wound him, and he swam across to
the city safe and sound.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> How thoroughly Rhodes and Mr. Stead’s ideas harmonized at
that time can best be seen from a comparison of Mr. Stead’s manifesto
to ‘all English-speaking Folk’, which was published in the
first number of the <i>Review of Reviews</i> (Eng.), which appeared not
long after, Jan. 15, 1891, with a letter, one of his few long letters,
which Rhodes wrote to Mr. Stead in August of that year (dated
Aug. 19-Sept. 3). See <i>Review of Reviews</i> (Eng.), Jan. 15, 1891, and

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
